  abstract = {We study the interaction between job and soft skills training on expectations and labor market outcomes in the context of a youth training program in the Dominican Republic. Program applicants were randomly assigned to one of 3 modalities: a full treatment consisting of hard and soft skills training plus an internship, a partial treatment consisting of soft skills training plus an internship, or a control group. We find strong and lasting effects of the program on personal skills acquisition and expectations, but these results are markedly different for young men and young women. Shortly after completing the program, both male and female participants report increased expectations for improved employment and livelihoods. This result is reversed for male participants in the long run, a result that can be attributed to the program's negative short-run effects on labor market outcomes for males. While these effects seem to dissipate in the long run, employed men are substantially more likely to be searching for another job. On the other hand, women experience improved labor market outcomes in the short run and exhibit substantially higher levels of personal skills in the long run. These results translate into women being more optimistic, having higher self-esteem and lower fertility in the long run. Our results suggest that job-training programs of this type can be transformative {\textendash} for women, life skills mattered and made a difference, but they can also have a downside if, like in this case for men, training creates expectations that are not met.},

We use digitized enrollee records from the CCC program in Colorado and New Mexico and matched these records to the 1940 Census, WWII enlistment records, Social Security Administration records, and death certificates. We find that enrollees who spent more time in CCC training grew taller, lived longer lives and had higher lifetime earnings as a result of their participation in the program. We also find modest increases in the educational attainment of the participants and increases in short term geographic mobility. In contrast, we find no evidence that their labor force participation or wages increased in the short run. To assess the internal and external validity of the results, we compare our estimates to those derived from a randomized evaluation of Job Corps, the modern version of the CCC, conducted in the 1990s. The RCT's results show that our empirical strategy delivers estimates that are in line with the experimental estimates. Overall, we find significant long-term benefits in both longevity and earnings, suggesting short and medium-term evaluations underestimate the returns of training programs, as do those that fail to consider effects on longevity.},

Although non-randomized, the two groups were found to be equivalent on important background variables. After 24 months, this first evaluation of MultifunC demonstrated that youth participating in MultifunC had a reduced need for residential care in a locked setting as well as out-of-home placement in general compared to youth in the TAU group. The economic analysis found MultifunC to be a cost-effective alternative to TAU due to the reduced need of residential care in locked settings. There were no significant effects on reoffending or psychiatric care.},

At the same time, such public training programs generally aim to improve the future quality of life of participants. While earnings is an important factor in attaining a better quality of life, there are surely other contributing factors. In this paper, we analyze the causal effect of the availability of a U.S. training program for youth{\textemdash}Job Corps{\textemdash}on future job quality. We define job quality by constructing a linear index that reduces a vector of job characteristics to a scalar quantity. In addition, we separately analyze several important characteristics of jobs. Our job quality index is consistent with the view that workers evaluate a job as a bundle of attributes that have some level of substitutability. Also, since our index is continuous, it permits us to evaluate the distributional impacts of training. Given that the quality of a job is defined only for employed individuals, we solve the selection-into-employment issue by estimating nonparametric bounds on the treatment effects of training for the latent subgroup of individuals that would be employed regardless of treatment assignment (a group that represents 65\% of the population). An advantage of this approach is that it relies on relatively weak assumptions while partially identifying causal effects of training on job quality. We find that Job Corps has significant effects on average quality that are bounded between 10 and 18 percent of a standard deviation in our job quality index. The distributional analysis suggests that the effects are heterogeneous over the distribution of the job quality index. Finally, we also note that effects are heterogeneous across different demographic groups analyzed.},

Abstract In this paper we perform an impact evaluation of the PCPI program, a public sponsored training program for the youth of the Catalonian Employment Service. This program, in its different variants, has the double objective of integrating participants into the labor market as well as re-engaging them back into the formal education system. Using a unique and rich database that combines administrative records from the unemployment office and the social security we apply the matching technique, in order to compare outcomes of participants and and non-participants unemployed individuals with similar observable characteristics. We are able to follow the labor and education outcomes for 3 years after the end of the program. We obtain that none of the variants of the PCPI program has a statistically significant labor impact in the medium term, although they do have a `lock in' effect in the short term. However, both variants of the program are quite effective in reengaging participants back into formal education, although the reengagement is not translated into higher graduation rates.},

  abstract = {There has recently been a strong drive to develop apprenticeship in France, as one means of decreasing youth unemployment. Our aim in this paper is to try to measure the "pure" within-firm training effect on school-to-work transition. We address the problem of the transition to the first job, using a model of simultaneous maximum likelihood estimation of several probabilities and of the parameters of the probability density function linked to the exit from unemployment. We conclude that apprentices have a distinct advantage over those who attended vocational school. This effect is stronger when we correct for the negative selection bias associated with the choice of apprenticeship.},

We fill this gap using administrative data on youth unemployment entries in 2002 and analyze the short- and long-term impacts for a variety of different programs. With informative data at hand we apply inverse probability weighting, thereby accounting for a dynamic treatment assignment and cyclical availability of programs. Our results indicate positive long-term employment effects for nearly all measures aimed at labor market integration. Measures aimed at integrating youths in apprenticeships are effective in terms of education participation, but fail to show any impact on employment outcomes until the end of our observation period. Public sector job creation is found to be harmful for the medium-term employment prospects and ineffective in the long-run. Our analysis further indicates that the targeting of German ALMP systematically ignores low-educated youths as neediest of labor market groups. While no employment program shows a positive impact on further education participation for any subgroup, the employment impact of participation is often significantly lower for low-educated youths.},

That strategy consisted of working within the main federal training program for disadvantaged youths {\textemdash} the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) system {\textemdash} to provide a combination of basic skills education, occupational training, support services, and job placement assistance for low-skilled, young school dropouts.

  abstract = {There has been a recent increase on research focusing on partial identification of average treatment effects in the program evaluation literature. In contrast with traditional point identification, partial identification approaches derive bounds on parameters of interest based on relatively weak assumptions. Thus, they deliver more credible results in empirical applications. This dissertation extends Instrumental Variable (IV) methods in the program evaluation literature by partially identifying treatment effects of interest when evaluating a program or intervention. An influential approach for studying causality within the IV framework was developed by Imbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996). They show that, when allowing for heterogeneous effects, IV estimators point identify the local average treatment effect (LATE) for compliers, whose treatment status is affected by the instrument. This dissertation advances the current IV literature in two important ways. First, inspired by the common criticism that LATE lacks external validity, this dissertation derives sharp nonparametric bounds for population average treatment effects (ATE) within the LATE framework. Second, the dissertation extends the LATE framework to bound treatment effects in the presence of both sample selection and noncompliance. Even when employing randomized experiments to evaluate programs -- as is now common in economics and other social science fields -- assessing the impact of the treatment on outcomes of interest is often made difficult by those two critical identification problems. The sample selection issue arises when outcomes of interest are only observed for a selected group. The noncompliance problem appears because some treatment group individuals do not receive the treatment while some control individuals do. The dissertation addresses both of these identification problems simultaneously and derives nonparametric bounds for average treatment effects within a principal stratification framework. More generally, these bounds can be employed in settings where two identification problems are present and there is a valid instrument to address one of them. The bounds derived in this dissertation are based on two sets of relatively weak assumptions: monotonicity assumptions on potential outcomes within specified subpopulations, and mean dominance assumptions across subpopulations. The dissertation employs the derived bounds to evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps (JC) program, which is the largest federally-funded job training program for disadvantaged youth in the United States, with the focus on labor market outcomes and welfare dependence. The dissertation uses data from an experimental evaluation of JC. Individuals were randomly assigned to a treatment group (whose members were allowed to enroll in JC) or to a control group (whose members were denied access to JC for three years). However, there was noncompliance: some individuals who were assigned to participate in JC did not enroll, while some individuals assigned to the control group did. The dissertation addresses this noncompliance issue using random assignment as an IV for enrollment into JC. Concentrating on the population ATE, JC enrollment increases weekly earnings by at least \$24.61 and employment by at least 4.3 percentage points four years after randomization, and decreases yearly dependence on public welfare benefits by at least \$84.29. These bounds are significantly narrower than the ones derived in the current IV literature. The dissertation also evaluates the effect of JC on wages, which are observed only for those who are employed. Hence, the sample selection issue has to be addressed when evaluating this effect. In the presence of sample selection and noncompliance, the average treatment effect of JC enrollment on wages for the always employed compliers, who would comply with their assigned treatment and who would be always employed regardless of their assignment statuses, is bounded between 5.7 percent and 13.9 percent four years after random assignment. The results suggest greater positive average effects of JC on wages than those found in the literature evaluating JC without adjusting for noncompliance. The dissertation closes by pointing out that a similar analytic strategy to the one used in this dissertation can be used to address other problems, for example, to bound the ATE when the instrument does not satisfy the exclusion restriction, and to derive bounds on the part of the effect of a treatment on an outcome that works through a given mechanism (i.e., direct or net effects) in the presence of one identification issue (e.g., noncompliance).},

Study questions: 1) What are the effects of vocational and business training programmes on women's income, working conditions, societal worth and economic empowerment? 2)What are the barriers to and facilitators of vocational and business training programme effectiveness? 3) What are the programme design and implementation characteristics associated with effective vocational and business training programmes for women? Inclusion criteria: The review included only experimental and quasi-experimental evaluations which measured the impact of vocational and business training programs in women 18 years and older, in low- and middle-income countries. The review also included qualitative and mixed-methods studies. The review also included studies published in English or Spanish and conducted after 1990 Number of included studies: The review included a total of 35 quantitative studies describing the impact of 30 interventions. The qualitative narrative meta-synthesis included findings on barriers to and facilitators of intervention effectiveness from 50 studies. Context/settings of included studies: Most of the included studies of vocational training took place in Latin America (n=11), with 3 from Africa, 2 from Asia and 2 from the Middle East. The business studies were distributed across the regions of Latin America (n=5), Africa (n=4) and Asia (n=3). The 5 studies examining the impact of the mixed interventions were all conducted in Africa in the countries of C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda. Study findings: Vocational training, on average, had positive but small effects on the employment, formal employment, earnings and income of women in LMIC. On average, vocational training increased the likelihood of employment and formal employment by 11\% (95\% CI=1.03, 1.18, evidence from 8 programmes) and 8\% (95\% CI=1.00, 1.18; evidence from 5 programmes) respectively. The average effect of vocational training on earnings was 5.54\% (95\% Ci=2.5\%, 8.96\%; evidence from 8 programs) or 0.11 standardised mean differences (95\% CI=0.05, 0.18; evidence from 8 programmes). There was no evidence that vocational training programmes that did and did not include life studies training or internships had different effects on employment, though there was some evidence that the effects of vocational training on earnings may increase with the inclusion of life skills training or an internship. Business training combined with cash transfers or life skills training had positive and statistically significant effects on the likelihood of self-employment. On average, business training increased women's sales or profits by 0.10 standardised mean differences (95\% CI=0.00, 0.20; evidence from four programmes).},

Despite considerable government investment in supporting the transition to adulthood for these youth, the evidence base to inform those investments remains limited. The study reported here uses a random-assignment evaluation design to assess the impact of the YVLifeSet program on young adults transitioning to adulthood from the child welfare and juvenile justice systems in the state of Tennessee. The evaluation identified positive impacts of the program on employment and earnings, housing instability, economic hardship, and health and safety. However, the program had no impact on measures of education, social support, criminal behavior and justice system involvement. The study findings provide guidance for future research and program development and raise questions about the appropriateness of traditional models of case management for transition-age youth.},

Courses were government funded Youth Conservation Corps programs. and consisted of work experience in National Parks (70\%). and classroom training (30\%). Measures used were the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale, the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg. 1972, 1978). and the l2-item neuroticism scale from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck. Eysenck \& Barrett. 1985). The courses resulted in significant improvements in self-esteem for participants. but not reductions in psychological distress. High pre-course levels of neuroticism were associated with poorer well-being for all subjects. For participants. post-course psychological distress scores. but not self-esteem scores. remained associated with neuroticism. Level of neuroticism was not related to well-being outcomes. Implications are that well-being is related to personality as well as situational and personal agency variables.},

In both experiments, the program dramatically reduces violent-crime arrests, even after the summer. It does so without improving employment, schooling, or other types of crime; if anything, property crime increases over 2-3 post-program years. To explore mechanisms, we implement a machine learning method that predicts treatment heterogeneity using observables. The method identifies a subgroup of youth with positive employment impacts, whose characteristics differ from the disconnected youth served in most employment programs. We find that employment benefiters commit more property crime than their control counterparts, and non-benefiters also show a decline in violent crime. These results do not seem consistent with typical theory about improved human capital and better labor market opportunities creating a higher opportunity cost of crime, or even with the idea that these programs just keep youth busy. We discuss several alternative mechanisms, concluding that brief youth employment programs can generate substantively important behavioral change, but for different outcomes, different youth, and different reasons than those most often considered in the literature.},

Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial examined two MST-EA Coaching approaches. In the Standard Coach + VR condition (n = 16), MST-EA Coaches delivered standard skills curricula to participants and referred them to state vocational rehabilitation (VR) services for vocational supports. In the Vocational Coach condition, (n = 16), MST-EA Coaches delivered the standard skills curricula enhanced with extensive education/employment components. Analyses included pre- to post-treatment comparisons of vocational outcomes, and between groups comparisons of fidelity, satisfaction, and services utilization. Results: Those in the Vocational Coach condition had a twelvefold increase in the odds of posttreatment vocational activity compared to those in the Standard Coach+VR condition (92.9\% vs. 57.1\% employed or in school, respectively). Subgroup analyses of those who engaged in Coaching showed that there was specifically an increase in the odds of post-treatment educational engagement among those in the Vocational Coach condition compared to those in Standard Coach +VR. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Based on the strength of the findings in this small pilot study the Vocational Coach should be included in future clinical trials of MST-EA to},

  abstract = {Network meta-analysis can synthesize evidence from studies comparing multiple treatments for the same disease. Sometimes the treatments of a network are complex interventions, comprising several independent components in different combinations. A component network meta-analysis (CNMA) can be used to analyze such data and can in principle disentangle the individual effect of each component. However, components may interact with each other, either synergistically or antagonistically. Deciding which interactions, if any, to include in a CNMA model may be difficult, especially for large networks with many components. In this article, we present two Bayesian CNMA models that can be used to identify prominent interactions between components. Our models utilize Bayesian variable selection methods, namely the stochastic search variable selection and the Bayesian LASSO, and can benefit from the inclusion of prior information about important interactions. Moreover, we extend these models to combine data from studies providing aggregate information and studies providing individual patient data (IPD). We illustrate our models in practice using three real datasets, from studies in panic disorder, depression, and multiple myeloma. Finally, we describe methods for developing web-applications that can utilize results from an IPD-CNMA, to allow for personalized estimates of relative treatment effects given a patient's characteristics.},

The usefulness of pairwise meta-analysis is thus limited in real-life medical practice, where many competing interventions may be available for a certain condition and studies informing some of the pairwise comparisons may be lacking. This commonly encountered scenario has led to the development of network meta-analysis (NMA). In the last decade, several applications, methodological developments, and empirical studies in NMA have been published, and the area is thriving as its relevance to public health is increasingly recognized.

  abstract = {The Youth Training Program (YTP) was an important component  of Argentina's active labor policy of the 1990s. The program offered courses of three months' duration, divided equally between  lectures and practical experience, and targeted young people, most  of whom were not employed and had a low level of education. The  program was offered by different institutions chosen through a  bidding process and included courses in the fields of agriculture,  manufacture, construction and services. This paper conducts an  econometric cost-benefit analysis of the fifth round of the YTP.  Benefits (wage increases, increase in likelihood of employment,  increase in earnings) are estimated using non-matching (Before  and After, Cross Section and Difference in Difference) and  matching techniques based on propensity score estimate (Nearest  Neighbor, Kernel, Local Linear Regression) in order to avoid  selection bias. Estimates of the ATE and TT effects are also  provided. A sample consisting of 1,670 beneficiaries and a  similarly-sized comparison group provided the information  necessary to apply the methodology. Benefit estimates are made  for the aggregate, by gender and for both youth and adults.  Regional differences are also provided. The cost includes direct  and indirect components and the alternative cost of beneficiaries  reducing their contributions to output during the program.  Estimates of rate of return are provided based on the previous  benefit and cost estimation. In general, the results support an  estimate of 10 percent of return. This looks reasonable if it is  compared with the very low rate of return of education estimated  separately for the participants group. Finally, the management of  the program is evaluated.},

Some early leavers wish to return to education. Second chance measures provide a means to return to education and potentially acquire a qualification. There are many reasons for leaving education early. Second chance measures are often delivered in a way that overcomes these. For example, some young people need to work due to their (family's) economic situation. Others have caring responsibilities. To take account of this, second chance education opportunities may be delivered outside normal study hours, through distance or blended learning (combination of online learning and traditional face-to-face instruction). Another factor which can lead to drop-out is that the traditional, classroom-based approach to learning is not appropriate for all young people. Second chance opportunities tend to use a different methodology, often inspired by VET pedagogies (e.g. more hands-on, more tailored to the interests of the learner) which can be more appealing. For young people with complex barriers to learning (e.g. health issues, housing, etc.), some second chance measures take a holistic approach and provide support to tackle these barriers, alongside formal learning, through a multi-professional case management approach.},

Notable features of BHBF included paid work experiences for youth and the application of external technical assistance in implementing the program model. Objective: The evaluation documented the design and implementation of BHBF and assessed its impacts on outcomes for youth three years after they enrolled in the study. Methods:We randomly assigned 859 youth who were receiving disability payments to either a treatment group that was eligible to receive both BHBF services and waivers of certain disability program rules, or to a control group that was not eligible for either the services or the waivers. Results: Three years after they enrolled in the study, treatment group youth were more likely than youth in the control group to be employed, their earnings were 50 percent higher, and they were less likely to have had contact with the justice system. Conclusion: Interventions that include work experiences as a service component can improve outcomes for youth with disabilities. Empirical monitoring of project staff, combined with technical assistance, may be necessary to ensure a consistent focus on helping youth to find jobs.},

Study Design and Setting Interventions consisted of between one and four components of psychological preparation: procedural information (P), sensory information (S), behavioral instruction (B), cognitive interventions (C), relaxation (R), and emotion-focused techniques (E). We used CNMA models to assess the effect of each component for three outcomes: length of stay, pain, and negative affect. Results We found evidence that the most effective component for reducing length of stay depends on the type of surgery and that R may improve pain. There was insufficient evidence that individual components contributed to the overall reduction in negative affect, but P and S emerged as the most likely beneficial components. Overall, we were unable to identify any one component as the most effective across all three outcomes. Conclusion The CNMA method allowed us to address questions about the effects of specific components that could not be answered using standard Cochrane methodology.},

  abstract = {The effects of a job training program, Job Corps, on both employment and wages are evaluated using data from a randomized study. Principal stratification is used to address, simultaneously, the complications of noncompliance, wages that are only partially defined because of nonemployment, and unintendedmissing outcomes. The first two complications are of substantive interest, whereas the third is a nuisance. The objective is to find a parsimonious model that can be used to inform public policy. We conduct a likelihood-based analysis using finite mixture models estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We maintain an exclusion restriction assumption for the effect of assignment on employment and wages for noncompliers, but not on missingness. We provide estimates under the "missing at random" assumption, and assess the robustness of our results to deviations from it. The plausibility of meaningful restrictions is investigated by means of scaled log-likelihood ratio statistics. Substantive conclusions include the following. For compliers, the effect on employment is negative in the short term; it becomes positive in the long term, but these effects are small at best. For always employed compliers, that is, compliers who are employed whether trained or not trained, positive effects on wages are found at all time periods. Our analysis reveals that background characteristics of individuals differ markedly across the principal strata. We found evidence that the program should have been better targeted, in the sense of being designed differently for different groups of people, and specific suggestions are offered. Previous analyses of this dataset, which did not address all complications in a principled manner, led to less nuanced conclusions about Job Corps. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Statistical Association.},

  abstract = {The Los Angeles Economic and Workforce Development Department (EWDD) created the Los Angeles Reconnections Career Academy (LARCA) program as a means of addressing the extensive education and employment needs of the city's sizable out-of-school youth population. Funded by a \$12 million Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) grant from the U.S. Department of Labor, the LARCA program provided chronically absent and dropout youth, ages 16 to 24, with education, training and employment services, alongside case management and other supportive services, using a career pathways model. The program operated from 2013 to 2015 and served over 1,000 youth. To evaluate the LARCA program, EWDD contracted with Social Policy Research Associates (SPR). This report presents the findings from the evaluation's random assignment impact study and cost study. Using administrative data from multiple state and local agencies, the impact study found that LARCA program participants re-enrolled in secondary and postsecondary education, and earned secondary education credentials and college credit at a higher rate than did control group members for up to two years after the point of random assignment. While the evaluation did not find impacts on employment, a longer follow-up period may have yielded different results. The report also presents the findings from the evaluation's cost study and costeffectiveness analysis, which found that the LARCA program spent more per participant to achieve the gains it produced than was spent on the WIA services that were available to the control group. These findings are likely due to LARCA being a new program with higher start-up and infrastructure costs as well as the evaluation's relatively short follow-up window in which to observe program impacts. Overall, the findings in this report contribute to the knowledge base of what works for out-ofschool youth, especially given that the LARCA program showed positive impacts in a city where the workforce system prioritizes out-of-school youth and offers a rich array of services that control group youth could easily access. This evaluation helps inform how to serve this population, and, more specifically, to address the increased emphasis placed on serving out-ofschool youth under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).},

The differences between the firms that provide the apprenticeship training are found to be small or insignificant.

  abstract = {This study examined effects of high school students' (n = 4050) participation in work-based learning programmes representing School-To- Work (STW) initiatives on their activities 1 year after graduation. Work based learning offered some advantage to participants compared to nonparticipants. Specifically, students who participated in the Career and Technology Education (CTE) programme had higher state-reported total and quarterly earnings, and self-reported higher hourly wage, and greater relevance of high school curriculum to their post-secondary education, training and employment than non-participants. CTE participants rated themselves better prepared in what to expect at the job and knowing technical information about the job than non-participants. Unexpectedly, interns had lower state-reported total earnings and number of quarters worked than non-interns. Interns rated themselves as equally prepared as non-interns in general work skills. Observations made during the evaluation suggested areas for improvement in the implementation and evaluation of STW activities, namely, the need for abstraction in STW programme development, implementation and evaluation, and the need for broader reach of students. {\textcopyright} 2001 Journal of Vocational Education and Training All rights reserved.},

This paper reports on a randomized experiment in Jordan in which female community college graduates were randomly assigned to a soft skills training program. Despite this program being twice as long in length as the average program in the region, and taught by a well-regarded provider, we find soft skills training does not have any significant employment impact in three rounds of follow-up surveys. We elicit expectations of academics and development professionals and reveal that these findings are novel and unexpected. JEL codes: O12, O15, J08, J16},

The program operates in the tri-county consortium of Riverside, San Bernardino, and Imperial counties, and provides services in five general areas: Life Coaching, Career Exploration, Education, Employment, and Work Readiness Preparation. The impact evaluation is a quasi-experimental design; Propensity Score Matching was used to form the comparison group. Findings from the impact evaluation show that @LIKE has a positive and statistically significant impact on the following outcomes: placement in unsubsidized employment, attainment of vocational training, completion of high school/GED, and program completion. Implementation findings included the following: key milestones and implementation of components were achieved; partnerships were built using effective leadership and building up staff in each county; and challenges included a moving target for the disconnected youth audience and hitting recruitment goals. Recommendations for successful implementation are also provided. The cost-benefit study findings indicated that the measured benefits of the @LIKE program exceed its measured costs, one year following program completion.},

Implementation began in 2008 with the recruitment of approximately 2,160 out-of-school youths (ranging in age from roughly 18 to 30). Of the 2,160 youths that applied to the TVVP, a random half were awarded a voucher for vocational training, while the other half served as the control group. Of the voucher winners, a random half were awarded a voucher that could only be used in public (government) institutions, while the other half received a voucher that could be used in either private or public institutions. The program also included a cross-cutting information intervention, which exposed a randomly selected half of all treatment and control individuals to information about the actual returns to vocational education. We find that voucher winners were significantly more likely to enroll in vocational education institutions and were able to acquire an additional 0.6 years of education. However, the information treatment did not affect educational attainment. We find limited evidence that the program increased earnings, although we found the program led to a significant increase in wage earnings among wage earners. provided exceptional research, managerial, organizational, and implementation assistance. The project was implemented and managed in collaboration with Innovations for Poverty Action-Kenya (IPAK).

  abstract = {Headline finding: Vocational programs can have an impact on the employment outcomes of young people with physical disabilities. Intervention(s): The program included a multi-disciplinary vocational rehabilitation intervention for young people with physical disabilities. In a community setting, a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation team delivered the Family Employment Awareness Training program to youth with disabilities such as autism, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy. One-on-one mentoring was part of the Back on Track program. The goal of the Adolescent Employment Readiness Center was to assist youth with disabilities in improving their quality of life and employment readiness outcomes during their early adolescence. Study questions: Our objectives are two-fold: (1) learning how work place intervention can affect skills and work outcome for young people (ages 15-25 years) with physical handicaps; and (2) learning about the common vocations in young people with physical handicaps. Inclusion criteria: The study included (1) an intentional vocational program (or intervention) (i.e., designed to assist young people with physical disabilities to gain jobs or professional education); (2) a sample of at least 50 percent of youth (aged 15,225) acquired, or conducted by a peer reviewing journal, a dissertation or a conference paper published in 1990 and January 2014; (3) (defined as a physical functional limitation, such as spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, congenital disorder, amputation, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, neuromuscular disease, scoliosis, movement disorder, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, or stroke). Number of included studies: 8 Context/settings of included studies: Two of the studies were carried out in the Netherlands, while the other six were carried out in the United States. The study's sample size ranged from 10 to 108 participants. Five studies used pre-post designs, two used mixed methods, and one used a quasi-experimental design. Study findings: After participating in a vocational program, the majority of participants gained unpaid or paid employment in six of the eight studies reviewed. Volunteer work was the only unpaid work available. Participation in vocational programs was associated with positive perceptions of obtaining and maintaining employment in five of the eight studies.},

Using rich nonexperimental data, we examine the performance of a two-stage evaluation methodology that (a) estimates the probability that a person participates in a programme and (b) uses the estimated probability in extensions of the classical method of matching. We decompose the conventional measure of programme evaluation bias into several components and find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important than other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction of the estimated programme impact. Matching methods applied to comparison groups located in the same labour markets as participants and administered the same questionnaire eliminate much of the bias as conventionally measured, but the remaining bias is a considerable fraction of experimentally-determined programme impact estimates. We test and reject the identifying assumptions that justify the classical method of matching. We present a nonparametric conditional difference-in-differences extension of the method of matching that is consistent with the classical index-sufficient sample selection model and is not rejected by our tests of identifying assumptions. This estimator is effective in eliminating bias, especially when it is due to temporally-invariant omitted variables.},

These findings provided justification for Congress to cut the budget of JTPA's youth component by over 80 percent. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of the experimental impact estimates along several dimensions of construction and interpretation. We find that the statistical significance of the male youth estimates is extremely fragile and that the magnitudes of the estimates for both youth groups are sensitive to nearly all the factors we consider. In particular, accounting for experimental control group members who substitute training from other providers leads to a much more positive picture regarding the effectiveness of JTPA classroom training. Our study indicates the value of sensitivity analyses in experimental evaluations and illustrates that experimental impact estimates, like those from nonexperimental analyses, require careful interpretation if they are to provide a reliable guide to policymakers.},

  abstract = {This study estimates the net impacts and private and social benefits and costs of nine workforce development programs administered in Washington State. Five of the programs serve job-ready adults: Community and Technical College Job Training, Private Career Schools, Apprenticeships, Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) Title III programs, and Community and Technical College Worker Retraining. Two of the programs serve adults with employment barriers: Community and Technical College Adult Basic Skills Education and JTPA Title II-A programs. The other two programs serve youth: JTPA Title II-C programs and Secondary Career Technical Education. The net impact analyses were conducted using a nonexperimental methodology. Individuals who encountered the workforce development programs were statistically matched to individuals who did not. Administrative data with information from the universe of program participants and Employment Service registrants (who served as the comparison group pool) supported the analyses. These data included over 10 years of pre-program and outcome information including demographics, employment and earnings information from the Unemployment Insurance wage record system, and transfer income information such as Food Stamp and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipiency and benefits. A variety of estimation techniques were used to calculate net impacts including comparison of means, regression-adjusted comparison of means, and difference-in-difference comparison of means. We estimated short-run net impacts that examined outcomes for individuals who exited from the education or training programs (or from the employment service) in the fiscal year 1999/2000 and longer-run impacts for individuals who exited in the fiscal year 1997/98. Short-run employment impacts a re positive for seven of the nine programs and negative for the other two. Short-run earnings impacts are insignificant for four of the programs, negative for two, and positive for the remaining three. The longer-run impacts are more sanguine. Employment impacts are positive for all nine programs, and earnings are positive for seven and insignificantly different from zero for the other two. The benefit-cost analyses show that all of the programs have discounted future benefits that far exceed the costs for participants, and that society also receives a positive return on investment.},

The implementation strategy is analyzed using various policy documents. The findings indicate that the program is apparently targeted at those groups of young people who are less disadvantaged as regards education level and previous unemployment experience. At the same time, paradoxically, the effects in terms of outflows from the unemployment register are weak for the short-term and medium-term unemployed, as well as for low-skilled and high-skilled youth, and stronger effects are evident in the case of long-term unemployed and medium-skilled youth. The failures in targeting and in adjusting the program to the needs of more vulnerable groups of youth are due to an inconsistent implementation strategy of Czech Public Employment Services.},

The paper analyzes the impact of the program on traditional labor market outcomes and on outcomes related to youth behavior and life style, expectations about the future and socio-emotional skills. In terms of labor market outcomes, the program has a positive impact on job formality for men of about 17 percent and there is also a seven percent increase in monthly earnings among those employed. However, there are no overall impacts on employment rates. Regarding non-labor market outcomes, the program reduces teenage pregnancy by five percentage points in the treatment group (about 45 percent), which is consistent with an overall increase in youth expectations about the future. The program also has a positive impact on non-cognitive skills as measured by three different scales. Scores improve between 0.08 and 0.16 standard deviations with the program. Although recent progress noted in the literature suggests that socio-emotional skills increase employability and quality of employment, the practical significance of the impacts is unclear, as there is only weak evidence that the life skills measures used are associated to better labor market performance. This is an area of growing interest and relevance that requires further research. JEL codes: J24, J64, O15, O17.},

Specific transition services included: vocational assessment, agency contacts, Individualized Educational Program (IEP) meetings, extended vocational training, employability counseling, job club, job interview preparation, job development, and job coaching. The results indicated that youth who received extended transition services had significantly higher earnings for two years following the termination of services than youth who did not receive extended transition services. Through a follow-up survey conducted five years after intervention services ended, we found that youth who received extended transition services were significantly more likely to be employed or in a training program than those without extended transition supports. No significant experimental group differences emerged based on gender, race, or disability.},

These are interventions designed to explicitly impact work participation. Study questions: 1) What work-focused interventions are most effective in supporting the employment of young adults with disabling health conditions? 2) Does the effectiveness of work-focused interventions differ for young adults living in different chronic disabling health conditions (e.g. mental health, intellectual/learning, physical and speech/hearing/visual disabilities)? 3)Do interventions and their effectiveness differ across the period of transition into the labour market (e.g. preparation, entry, sustaining work and advancement within employment? Inclusion criteria: The study included studies published between January 1990 and July 2018. The study included studies that targeted young adults with chronic disabling health conditions including mental health, intellectual/learning, physical or speech/hearing/visual disability. Number of included studies: 5,816 articles were identified and of these, 10 were relevant for the qualitative synthesis Context/settings of included studies: All the 10 studies were from High Income Countries, with 6 from the USA, 2 from Australia, one from the UK and the other from Australia. Study findings: The interventions in the included studies were tailored supported employment (SE) (n=8), Tailored SE in combination with a disease-specific work intervention (SE+) (n=2), Tailored SE in combination with self-disclosure training (n=1), Youth transition demonstration (YTD) enhanced employment (n=1) and Technology-based job interviewing training (n=1). Eight of the 10 studies examined the impact of the intervention on competitive employment. Three studies also assessed employment in any job as the outcome, some studies looked at job tenure, employment income and hours worked. There was a strong evidence for SE on competitive employment. Moderate evidence was available for the effect of SE on employment in any job. Insufficient evidence was identified for the use of other interventions including SE+, SE and self-disclosure training, YTD and technology-based job interviewing training. A moderate level of evidence existed for the use of SE to support competitive employment for young adults with mental health conditions. There was not enough evidence to support the use of SE for competitive employment for young adults with mental health conditions and other disabling health conditions.},

For the purpose of assisting a successful transition of foster care youth to adulthood, states provide Independent Living Services (ILS) with federal funding support. This study aims to test ILS's effects on educational attainment and employment of foster care youth. We employ multi-state data sources: the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Outcome survey, NYTD service files, and the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, collected from foster youth (N = 4206). The dependent variables are high school completion, post-secondary education, and full-time employment measured at age 21. The independent variable is any ILS use in the following areas during the ages of 17{\textendash}18: academic support, career preparation, employment or vocational training, mentoring, or education financial assistance. Propensity Score Matching was used to adjust for potential selection bias and pre-existing differences in observation data between youth who received and did not receive ILS. The weighted logistic regression analyses show that foster youth using ILS are significantly more likely to complete high school education (Odds Ratio = 1.25, p =.03), have a post-secondary education (Odds Ratio = 1.20, p =.03), and work full-time (Odds Ratio = 1.24, p =.04) in emerging adulthood. We discuss the gaps and challenges in current research that estimates ILS effects. The findings suggest that it is critical to fully implement these services, explore approaches for providing more complete and equitable access, and continue work that further explicates key factors in receipt and effectiveness of ILS for transition-aged youth.},

One of steps taken towards decreasing it by the European Union has been the program Youth Guarantee, implemented by a number of member states. Despite the relatively lower youth unemployment, the Czech Republic has implemented this program as well, and supported the realization of the project Internships for Young Job Seekers, whose aim was to ease the transition for students from schools to the labour market thanks to internships in companies. The effects which internship related project bring for their participants have been evaluated in other EU countries, mainly in Germany, but also in Sweden or France. However, evidence about internships' effectiveness has been missing for the Czech Republic, and this paper fills this existing knowledge gap with the use of counterfactual impact evaluation methods. In the paper, we have focused on examining the impacts of internships on personal income and economic status of trainees by using the propensity score matching, difference-in-differences estimation and two complementary methods {\textendash} ordinary least squares and multinomial logit. The results confirmed a positive impact of internships on treated project participants regarding both outcome variables, and thus, are consistent with the majority of literature in the field.},

Wage rates are only observed for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest. Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

Ethnic minorities are not only more likely to face unemployment, previous experiences of unemployment also carry more enduring scars for them than for the majority group in terms of reemployment and pay. Even with similar levels of prior unemployment, ethnic minorities are more susceptible to delayed re-entry and wage penalties than are their white British peers. The life-course trajectories in unemployment and lower pay, coupled with unemployment scarring, suggest cumulative ethnic disadvantages in the UK.},

Researchers found that implementation was strong, but program impacts were less impressive. While SCEP's participants got summer jobs at a substantially higher rate (92\%) than the control group (62\%), the program's ability to translate this large and immediate summer employment impact into intermediate gains (in terms of future plans, college enrollment, work success, sense of self-efficacy or reduced criminal activity) proved to be negligible. Although impacts were short lived, the report concludes that SCEP and similar programs have an important place in the larger mosaic of supports, programs and opportunities for young people. Three appendixes are included: (1) Overview of Agencies Implementing SCEP; (2) Funders of 1198 and/or 1999 Summer Career Exploration Program; and (3) Study Methods.

  abstract = {Overview High  school  dropouts  face  an  uphill  battle  in  a  labor  market  that  increasingly  rewards  skills  and  postsecondary credentials: they are more likely than their peers to need public assistance, be arrested or  incarcerated,  and  less  likely  to  marry.  This  report presents  results  from  a  rigorous  evaluation  of  the  National  Guard  Youth  Challenge  Program,  an  intensive  residential  program  that  aims  to  ``reclaim  the  lives  of  at-risk  youth''  who  have  dropped  out.  More  than  100,000  young  people  have  completed the program since it was launched in the early 1990s. MDRC is conducting the evaluation in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood.  The  17-month  Challenge  program  is  divided  into  three phases:  Pre-Challenge,  a  two-week  orientation  and  assessment  period;  a  20-week  Residential  Phase;  and  a  one-year  Post-residential  Phase  featuring  a  mentoring  program.  During  the  first  two  phases,  participants  live  at  the  program  site, often on a military base. The environment is ``quasi-military,'' though there are no requirements for military service. The evaluation uses a random assignment design. Because there were more qualified applicants than slots,  a  lottery-like  process  was  used  to  decide  which  applicants  were  admitted  to  the  program.  Those who were admitted (the program group) are being compared over time with those who were not admitted (the control group); any significant differences that emerge between the groups can be attributed to Challenge. About 3,000 young people entered the study in 10 Challenge programs in 2005-2006.},

This reality poses a particular challenge for out-of-school youth, who are no longer connected to institutions designed to provide them with training and connect them to good jobs. The Center for Employment Training (CET) in San Jose, California, is one such institution. CET in San Jose, with its training in a work like setting and involvement of local employers, showed promise as a program for youth, having produced large positive effects on their employment and earnings in two earlier studies in the late 1980s. Based on these earlier results, the U.S. Department of Labor launched the Evaluation of the Center for Employment Training Replication Sites in the mid-1990s, which was designed to test whether the CET model could be implemented successfully in different settings and have similarly positive effects on the youth served. This final report on the evaluation summarizes the replication effort's success and effects on youth after four and a half years. It shows that, even in the sites that best implemented the model, CET had no overall employment and earnings effects for youth in the program, even though it increased participants' hours of training and receipt of credentials.

The first uses an estimator which weights observations by the inverse of the propensity score. This estimator let us conclude that, for participants, the time needed to find a job is reduced in 471 days. The second one is the differences estimator, it let us conclude that the time needed to find a job is reduced in 448 days. The evaluated program works as an active labour market policy with favourable effects on unemployed young people. Compared with other research in Spain, the obtained results show evidence in the same way as most of evaluation but stronger.

  abstract = {Foster youth in the U.S. often face a multitude of adverse outcomes, including low educational attainment, elevated rates of adult poverty, and disproportionately high levels of adult homelessness. One newer area of social policy research and advocacy, asset building, may help explain some of these disparities. Foster youth face several barriers to asset building. For example, many youth have several placements during their stay in care, resulting in youth receiving inconsistent schooling, mentoring, and support, and facing limited opportunities to work, save money, or build academic and professional networks. This paper examines the frequency with which transition-age foster youth receive asset building services and whether the youth who receive services experience improved outcomes compared to those who do not. Analyzing data from the National Youth in Transition Database and using a Propensity Score Matching methodology, this study finds that youth receiving Budgeting and Financial Education Services and Post-Secondary Education Services experience significantly improved outcomes, including reduced likelihood of homelessness and increased likelihood of employment and educational enrollment. However, only 29\% of youth receive Budgeting and Financial Education Services, and only 19\% of youth receive Post-Secondary Education Services. Service receipt also covaries with demographics, including race/ethnicity and education level. These findings have noteworthy implications for both policy and practice as asset building for foster youth is a potentially promising realm for public service expansion.},

  abstract = {A critical impediment to research on school-to-work programs has been the absence of large representative data sets with information on such programs. In contrast, the new NLSY (NLSY97)offers researchers opportunities to analyze direct evidence on school-to-work programs. In theNLSY97, individuals are asked a set of survey questions about "programs schools offer to help students prepare for the world of work," and an accompanying survey includes information on school-to-work programs offered by schools attended by the interviewees. These data, coupled with observations on multiple individuals in the same schools, potentially allow researchers to estimate the effects of school-to-work programs on individuals while accounting for possible bias from selection into these programs, although apparent data problems pose some limitations. Because Round One of the NLSY97 covers workers only up to age 17, this paper focuses on the consequences of school-to-work programs for youth employment and schooling decisions while in high school, and students' subjective assessments of the likelihood of future schooling and work behavior. Overall, the evidence does not point to a causal effect of school-to-work program participation on behavior likely associated with future college attendance. On the other hand, school-to-work program participation does appear to have positive effects on educational attainment in terms of respondents' subjective probabilities of obtaining a high-school diploma. More in accordance with the traditional view of school-to-work programs, the data indicate that participation in these programs increases the perceived likelihood of future labor market activity, both for the year following the survey and at age 30. However, school-to-work programs do not appear to boost the probability of current employment.},

While   many   young   people manage successfully to navigate   this increasingly  complicated  course,  a  large  number  experience  significant difficulties along the way. There is considerable concern that, either as a consequence of these difficulties, or for other reasons, many young people are deciding against, or being prevented from, participating fully in civil society.

  abstract = {Active labour market policies (ALMPs) that connect people to good jobs will help to promote an equitable and sustained recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Labour demand measures have been vital to preserve jobs in the short term and countries have begun to implement a suite of training programmes for displaced workers. Getting the correct balance of ALMPs is essential for ensuring an effective use of resources that reach, the people in need, including those most at risk of permanent detachment from the labour market and respond well to their needs. This policy brief highlights how OECD countries and a number of other countries have responded to the crisis in adapting and expanding the suite of ALMPs that they offer to prepare for an inclusive recovery. Designing active labour market policies for the recovery 2 {\textbar} DESIGNING ACTIVE LABOUR MARKET POLICIES FOR THE RECOVERY {\textcopyright} OECD 2021 Key messages and policy options {\textbullet} The set of active labour market policies (ALMPs) that countries offer should be flexible and responsive, to allow quick and proportionate reactions to economic shocks. Policies that stimulate labour demand can prevent excessive unemployment that may hinder the recovery. This allows greater headway to focus on reorientation towards training policies that can help economies reallocate labour to support economic restructuring. {\textbullet} During the pandemic, OECD and EU countries scaled up and introduced measures to support the demand for labour through employment incentives, such as hiring subsidies and social security waivers. This has been particularly useful in the crisis time to limit the jobs fallout, complement short-time work schemes and prevent detachment of people from the labour market. In line with the evidence that targeting of these measures can increase their effectiveness, many countries targeted their new measures on young people, long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, older unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. As economies start to recover, countries should scale back public works programmes and target employment incentives more tightly. {\textbullet} Recognising that training will be vital to match workers to jobs in the short-and long-run, countries have augmented training offers during the pandemic to support reallocation of workers and to upskill those at risk of displacement. At the same time, the training offer has been adapted to the COVID-situation, with 76\% of OECD and EU countries moving training online and 70\% introducing new online courses, while 28\% have also funded additional places in institutional training. {\textbullet} Special emphasis has been placed on training in the use of digital tools. The crisis has shown that digitalisation can increase resilience and preserve capacity in the face of stringent restrictions to physical interaction. To make digital service provision more inclusive going forward, further efforts are needed to ensure that all individuals have the skills and access to technology needed to benefit from these services. {\textbullet} With a full labour market recovery still far off in many countries, it is crucial to ensure that ALMPs are effective, reach the people in need and respond well to their needs. Evaluating the impact of the measures introduced or redesigned during the pandemic is essential to promote cost-effectiveness. Countries should continue their efforts to integrate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in their policy making process.},

In this study, we used the survey data collected on program participants and nonparticipants in 11 communities over a three-year period (2016 to 2018). We used the difference-in-difference method to examine the effectiveness of the program while controlling for both observed and unobserved characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups. We focused on the two primary outcomes of the program: (1) intention to find a job and (2) probability of being not in employment, education, or training (NEET). The analysis results show that the intention of the program participants to find a job increased to 8.3\% compared to that of non-participants during the three-year program period. We also found the positive effect of the program on reducing the risk of NEET. The probability of being NEET of the program participants decreased to 6.6\% more compared to non-participants during the three-year period. We provide discussion of the possible policy implications and limitations of this study.},

To address the issue, we have resorted to a counterfactual approach with data from two main sources: the program administration and compulsory communications on employment and unemployment spells. We found a net impact of +5pp on average; we found positive effects for on-the-job training, but no impact for off-the-job training. On-the-job training also affects the probability to find permanent work (+3pp). This is consistent with the view that young people have excellent theoretical, but very little work-related competences. Off-the-job training does affect the probability to experience at least one labor contract after 2016. These results are partly due to a lock-in effect, namely the tendency of those who attend training programs to delay their job search. Interestingly, we found that the program has a different impact for different typologies of recipients and different types of intervention. In a nutshell, active labor policy works when it generates work-related competences.},

It is therefore important both theoretically and clinically to examine whether specific components of CBT or their combinations are superior to others in the treatment of panic disorder. Component network meta-analysis (NMA) is an extension of standard NMA that can be used to disentangle the treatment effects of different components included in composite interventions. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central, with supplementary searches of reference lists and clinical trial registries, for all randomized controlled trials comparing different CBT-based psychological therapies for panic disorder with each other or with control interventions. We applied component NMA to disentangle the treatment effects of different components included in these interventions. After reviewing 2526 references, we included 72 studies with 4064 participants. Interoceptive exposure and face-to-face setting were associated with better treatment efficacy and acceptability. Muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure were associated with significantly lower efficacy. Components such as breathing retraining and in vivo exposure appeared to improve treatment acceptability while having small effects on efficacy. The comparison of the most v. the least efficacious combination, both of which may be provided as 'evidence-based CBT,' yielded an odds ratio for the remission of 7.69 (95\% credible interval: 1.75 to 33.33). Effective CBT packages for panic disorder would include face-to-face and interoceptive exposure components, while excluding muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure.},

  abstract = {In network meta-analysis (NMA), treatments can be complex interventions, for example, some treatments may be combinations of others or of common components. In standard NMA, all existing (single or combined) treatments are different nodes in the network. However, sometimes an alternative model is of interest that utilizes the information that some treatments are combinations of common components, called component network meta-analysis (CNMA) model. The additive CNMA model assumes that the effect of a treatment combined of two components A and B is the sum of the effects of A and B, which is easily extended to treatments composed of more than two components. This implies that in comparisons equal components cancel out. Interaction CNMA models also allow interactions between the components. Bayesian analyses have been suggested. We report an implementation of CNMA models in the frequentist R package netmeta. All parameters are estimated using weighted least squares regression. We illustrate the application of CNMA models using an NMA of treatments for depression in primary care. Moreover, we show that these models can even be applied to disconnected networks, if the composite treatments in the subnetworks contain common components.},

  abstract = {Network meta-analysis is a method to combine evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare a number of different interventions for a given clinical condition. Usually, this requires a connected network. A possible approach to link a disconnected network is to add evidence from nonrandomized comparisons, using propensity score or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons methods. However, nonrandomized comparisons may be associated with an unclear risk of bias. Schmitz et al. used single-arm observational studies for bridging the gap between two disconnected networks of treatments for multiple myeloma. We present a reanalysis of these data using component network meta-analysis (CNMA) models entirely based on RCTs, utilizing the fact that many of the treatments consisted of common treatment components occurring in both networks. We discuss forward and backward strategies for selecting appropriate CNMA models and compare the results to those obtained by Schmitz et al. using their matching method. CNMA models provided a good fit to the data and led to treatment rankings that were similar, though not fully equal to that obtained by Schmitz et al. We conclude that researchers encountering a disconnected network with treatments in different subnets having common components should consider a CNMA model. Such models, exclusively based on evidence from RCTs, are a promising alternative to matching approaches that require additional evidence from observational studies. CNMA models are implemented in the R package netmeta.},

This study evaluated the capacity of a promising vocational and employment training program in the building sector (i.e., Community Restitution Apprenticeship-Focused Training, CRAFT) to mitigate such outcomes through enhanced employment and education. Participants were 97 high-risk juvenile offenders (mean age = 15.8. years) randomized to CRAFT versus education as usual (EAU) intervention conditions. Multi-method procedures measured employment, education, substance use, mental health, and criminal outcomes through a 30-month post-baseline follow-up. CRAFT was significantly more effective than EAU at increasing rates of youth employment and GED attendance. Intervention effects were not observed, however, for months employed, hours worked, or hourly wage. Measures of youth substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal activity showed no favorable or iatrogenic effects. The potential of CRAFT was modestly supported, and suggestions were made for future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A common problem of welfare states consists of a high unemployment risk for low-skilled workers. This is often attributed to a lack of jobs for the low-skilled, but it may as well be caused by a lack of incentives to work. Low-skilled workers are easily substitutable and therefore have little bargaining power. Hence, they are typically dependent on low-paid jobs. This may create disincentives to work, if the achievable market wage does not sufficiently exceed the welfare level. Workfare could be an efficient strategy to overcome such disincentives by introducing a work requirement for unemployed welfare recipients. In our paper we investigate the importance of such a supply side policy. We evaluate a pilot workfare project of a Berlin city community to integrate young people in social assistance into the labor market. Reference data are generated in collaboration with the German Employment Office. The participation effect is found to be positive and of relevant size, but not statistically significant. This indicates that selection biases detected in the allocation process of individuals to the program can be adjusted by econometric techniques, but only at the prize of reduced significance levels. Given the small sample sizes of pilot projects this calls for social experiments in controlled project designs.},

This study measures whether the analysis of administrative earnings has similar findings for employment and earnings as surveys, and what the impacts on employment and earnings are in the two and a half years past the four-year period of the survey. Implementing agency: U.S. Department of Labour (DOL). Context/population: The participants are disadvantaged youth aged 16 to 24-years-old in the United States. Study design: Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). A total of 9,409 participants were randomly assigned to the programme group to have the opportunity to enrol in the Job Corps and if they decided not to enrol they were considered no-shows. The control group had 5,977 eligible participants who do not participate in the Job Corps but have the opportunity to enrol in other programmes. The administrative records were used to analyse differences between these impact results and those of the survey. Study findings: To begin, the SER administrative data and the survey report a negative impact on earnings in 1995 and 1996, but then a positive impact in 1997 and 1998. Moreover, the data on reported earnings for the survey reports higher increases than the administrative data found. Similarly, the quarterly employment rates are higher for the survey data than the administrative data, but the annual rates are similar. Furthermore, reporting differences in 1998 reveal different earnings gains for that year between the two data sources. Next, after the period of four years covered by the survey, the administrative data shows no impact of the Job Corps programme on earnings or employment with the only exception being the age group 20- to 24-year-olds whose results have stayed the same across the survey and the administrative data. The benefit-cost estimates from the administrative data analysis report that the programme costs of the Job Corps outweigh the benefits to society, however, the programme is still cost-effective for the 20 to 24-year-old group whose results for earnings remained after the survey period. Finally, the Job Corps programme is still beneficial for participants because the services they receive make up for lost earnings.},

It is often the case that we deal with interventions that consist of multiple, possibly interacting, components. Examples of interventions' components include characteristics of the intervention, mode (face-to-face, remotely etc.), location (hospital, home etc.), provider (physician, nurse etc.), time of communication (synchronous, asynchronous etc.) and other context related components. Networks of multicomponent interventions are typically sparse and classical NMA inference is not straightforward and prone to confounding. Ideally, we would like to disentangle the effect of each component to find out what works (or does not work). To this aim, we propose novel ways of visualizing the NMA results, describe their use, and illustrate their application in real-life examples. We developed an R package viscomp to produce all the suggested figures.},

First, vocational training has an economically meaningful impact~on youth labor market outcomes (+0.105SD), twice that reported in previous reviews. Second, country income level does not predict effect size magnitude {\textendash} implying that well-designed interventions can work irrespective of labor market challenges. Third, the time-profile and mechanism of successful trainings differ between High-income countries (HICs) and Lower-/Middle-income countries (L/MICs). In HICs, effect sizes increase over time and more intensive interventions yield larger impacts. In L/MICs, shorter interventions are associated with larger effect sizes but these are often short-lived. Our findings suggest that mechanisms of effective interventions differ: impacts result from a human-capital mechanism of training in HICs and from a signaling and screening mechanism in L/MIC.},

However, the parametric models that are commonly used to analyse the causal effect of education presume that educational attainments form an ordered sequence. This has the effect of restricting the effects of educational attainments on earnings. This paper departs from this restrictive approach. It estimates the effect of Year 12 completion and VET qualifications on early career earnings using both a single and multiple treatment-effect approach. By using matching methods to estimate these effects, it also allows for the effects of educational qualifications differ between persons. It is found that neither completion of Year 12 nor a VET qualification has an effect on early career earnings over and above the forgone experience.},

In 2012, SOR was redesigned to ease the first labor market entry and promote on-the-job training, enabling a young person without relevant work experience to get a one-year contract and a net monthly remuneration of 210 euro, while after 2014, the measure also became a part of the European Youth Guarantee. Pooling Croatian Labor Force Surveys from 2007 to 2016 and using the difference-in-difference strategy, we estimate the causal intent-to-treat effect of the program reform on labor market outcomes. The main results indicate that the reform has had, at best, neutral effects on employment and unemployment, while there is evidence that a portion of young individuals was propelled into inactivity. Though expected, adverse effect on wages{\textemdash}both at the mean and at higher percentiles of the wage distribution{\textemdash}is driven mostly by wages received by women and university graduates.},

Inclusion criteria: 1) The studies must have evaluated an intervention with the means to improve the labour market situation of adults with disabilities 2) The studies should have targeted adults aged 16 to 65-years-old with physical and/or sensory impairments associated with disability 3) The study must have been in a LMIC 4) The study must have used: randomised experimental design, rigorous quasi-experimental design that used robust methods for removing biases due to non-random assignment of treatment 5) Studies must have reported at least one quantitative employment-related outcome variable 6) the date of publication or reporting of the study must have been within the period of 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2013. Number of included studies: Literature search yielded a total of 20,417 relevant reports, but a total of 14 studies met the eligibility criteria. Context/settings of included studies: Studies were conducted from 9 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is the breakdown of the studies: Bangladesh (3), Brazil (2), China (1); India (4); Kenya (1), Nigeria (1), Philippines (1), Vietnam (1), and Zimbabwe (1). Study findings: The studies examined 15 different interventions: treatment and therapy (4 interventions); assistive devices and accommodations (two interventions); occupational rehabilitation services (4 interventions); financial services (1 intervention) and community-based rehabilitation (4 interventions). The relevant labour market outcomes assessed included: motivation to work (1 study), professional social skills (1 study), employment participation (12 studies), self-employment (2 studies), income (4 studies), and hours worked (1 study). Five studies measured additional outcomes: health-related outcome (4 studies), social outcomes (5 studies), and empowerment-related outcome (1 study). In the 14 studies, the effect was positive.},

The intervention modified a program titled Project SEARCH and incorporated the use of applied behavior analysis to develop Project SEARCH plus Autism Spectrum Disorder Supports. A randomized clinical trial compared the implementation of Project SEARCH plus Autism Spectrum Disorder Supports with high school special education services as usual. Participants were 49 high-school-aged individuals between the ages of 18 and 21 years diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and eligible for supported employment. Students also had to demonstrate independent self-care. At 3 months post-graduation, 90\% of the treatment group acquired competitive, part-time employment earning US\$9.53-US\$10.66 per hour. Furthermore, 87\% of those individuals maintained employment at 12 months post-graduation. The control group's employment outcomes were 6\% acquiring employment by 3 months post-graduation and 12\% acquiring employment by 12 months post-graduation. The positive employment outcomes generated by the treatment group provide evidence that youth with autism spectrum disorder can gain and maintain competitive employment. Additionally, there is evidence that they are able to advance within that time toward more weekly hours worked, while they also displayed increasing independence in the work setting.},

This answers the research question, ``Are psychological interventions in general effective?'' In fact, psychological interventions are usually complex with several different components. The authors propose that mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis methods may be a valuable tool when exploring the efficacy of interventions with different components and combinations of components, as this allows one to answer the research question, ``Are interventions with a particular component (or combination of components) effective?'' The authors illustrate the methods using a meta-analysis of psychological interventions for patients with coronary heart disease for a variety of outcomes. The authors carried out systematic literature searches to update an earlier Cochrane review and classified components of interventions into 6 types: usual care, educational, behavioral, cognitive, relaxation, and support. Most interventions were a combination of these components. There was some evidence that psychological interventions were effective in reducing total cholesterol and standardized mean anxiety scores, that interventions with behavioral components were effective in reducing the odds of all-cause mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and that interventions with behavioral and/or cognitive components were associated with reduced standardized mean depression scores.},

This article contributes innovatively to several statistical aspects of CNMA. First, by introducing a unified notation, we establish that currently available methods differ in the way they assume additivity, an important distinction that has been overlooked so far in the literature. In particular, one model uses a more restrictive form of additivity than the other which we term an anchored and unanchored model, respectively. We show that an anchored model can provide a poor fit to the data if it is misspecified. Second, given that Bayesian models are often preferred by practitioners, we develop two novel unanchored Bayesian CNMA models presented under the unified notation. An extensive simulation study examining bias, coverage probabilities, and treatment rankings confirms the favorable performance of the novel models. This is the first simulation study to compare the statistical properties of CNMA models in the literature. Finally, the use of our novel models is demonstrated on a real dataset, and the results of CNMA models on the dataset are compared.},

Inclusion criteria: The studies were included if they met the following criteria 1) Involved a school-based or affiliated psychological, educational or behavioural prevention or intervention program intended to have beneficial effects on students recipients; or evaluated a community-based program explicitly presented as a dropout prevention or intervention program 2) Investigated outcomes for interventions directed towards school-aged youth, or those expected to attend pre-k to 12th grade primary and secondary schools or the equivalent. 3) Used experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, including random assignment, non-random assignment with matching or non-random assignment with statistical controls or sufficient information to permit calculation of pre-treatment effect size group equivalence. 4) Reported at least one eligible outcome variable measuring school completion, school dropout, high school graduation or school attendance. 5) The date of publication or reporting of the study must have been in 1985 or later. Number of included studies: 548 reports describing 167 different studies were included. Context/settings of included studies: A large proportion of the literature on dropout program was not published in peer-reviewed journals, but rather in technical reports (55\%) or dissertations (22\%). Most of the technical reports were of high quality and published by government and non-government agencies. A great proportion of the technical reports used random assignment designs (49\%) than did the journal articles (24\%). Attrition averaged about 11\% across the studies of general programs that reported it. Study findings: Both general dropout programs and programs specialized for teen parents were effective in reducing school dropout (or increasing school completion). The random effects weighted means OR was 1.72 for general programs (dropout rate = 21.1\% in the control groups and 13\% in the program groups). For the teen parent programs, the mean OR for graduation and dropout outcomes was 1.83 (average graduation rate= 26\% for the control and 39\% for the programs) and was 1.55 for school enrolment outcomes (average enrolment rate for comparison mothers= 33\% and 43\% for the programs)},

  abstract = {Government-sponsored job-training programs must be subject to evaluation to assess whether their effectiveness justifies their cost to the public. The evaluation usually focuses on employment and total earnings, although the effect on wages is also of interest, because this effect reflects the increase in human capital due to the training program, whereas the effect on total earnings may be simply reflecting the increased likelihood of employment without any effect on wage rates. Estimating the effects of training programs on wages is complicated by the fact that, even in a randomized experiment, wages are "truncated" (or less accurately "censored") by nonemployment, that is, they are only observed and well-defined for individuals who are employed. In this article, we develop a likelihood-based approach to estimate the wage effect of the US federally-funded Job Corps training program using "Principal Stratification". Our estimands are formulated in terms of: (1) the effect of the training program on wages for those who would be employed whether they were trained or not, also called the survivor average causal effect (SACE), and the proportion of people in this category; (2) the wages when trained for those who would be employed only when trained, and the proportion of people in this category; (3) the wages when not trained for those who would be employed only when not trained, and the proportion of people in this category; (4) the proportion of people who would be not employed whether trained or not. We conduct likelihood-based analysis using the EM algorithm, and investigate the plausibility of important submodels with scaled loglikelihood ratio statistics.We also conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to specific parametric assumptions. Our results suggest that all four types of people [(1)-(4) previously] exist, which is impossible under the usual monotonicity assumptions made in traditional econometric evaluation methods. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Statistical Association.},

The current study uses random assignment to evaluate the impact of an employment assistance programme for foster youth on the rate of employment, income and other self-sufficiency outcomes among a group of adolescents in substitute care in Kern County, California. Data were collected via multi-wave, in-person interviews of 254 foster youth. At the second follow-up interview, only two-fifths of the sample report being employed. However, three-quarters of the sample are either working or attending school, and a quarter reports both working and attending school. Nevertheless, significant minorities report experiencing financial hardships and receiving financial assistance. No statistically significant impacts of the evaluated programme are found on any measured employment or self-sufficiency outcome. Implications for child welfare policy are discussed.},
