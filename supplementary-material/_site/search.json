Of those combinations, twelve (n=12) solely use direct evidence. Another eleven (n=11) use mixed evidence i.e., a combination of direct and indirect evidence.\nNote that the number of studies for each combination of components using mixed evidence is very small — there are only five combinations of components that use two or more studies — as a result, care needs to be taken into drawing conclusions from any observed inconsistency.\nApplication of the SIDE method identified a moderate amount of overall heterogeneity (\\(\\tau\\) = 0.180). Inconsistency between indirect and direct evidence was assessed using I2. Inconsistency appears to be present in three combinations, as indicated by an I2 value of 80 or more:\n\nLife Skills Training + Coaching and Mentoring + Other versus Services as Usual (I2: 98%)\nOff-the-Job Training versus Services as Usual (I2: 97%)\nOff-the-Job Training + On-the-Job Training + Other versus Services as Usual (I2: 88%)\n\nIn interpreting these results its important to note that I2 is a relative — as opposed to absolute — measure of heterogeneity Borenstein, Higgins, Hedges, & Rothstein (2017). Therefore taken together, these results suggest that of the moderate amount of heterogeneity that was identified, most it is true heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Forest plot visualising inconsistency within the network for employment status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.8.2 Assessing global incoherence\nThe ‘between designs’ decomposition of Cochran’s Q for employment status is presented in Table 13 below. The results suggest that the level of heterogeneity within the included designs (i.e., combinations of components) is not significant. However, caution should be taken in the interpretation of these results as the number of included studies with mixed evidence is low.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13: Cochran’s Q for employment status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nQ\ndf\np-value\nSquare-root of between study variance\n\n\n\n\nBetween designs\n8.373\n4\n0.079\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.9 Subgroup analysis\n\n5.1.9.1 Study confidence\nAmong studies that reported employment status outcomes, sixteen (n=16) were assessed as ‘high confidence’, and forty-five (n=45) were ‘low’ or ‘medium confidence’.\nFigure 13 presents this analysis. There were no significant differences between the two groups. While off-the-job training for low to medium confidence studies appears significant, this is most likely to be the result of a reduction in statistical power due to the relatively small number of studies considered ‘high confidence’.\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Forest plot depicting the result of subgroup analysis for employment status by study confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Studies in which we have low or medium confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Studies in which we have high confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.9.2 Study location\nOf the fifty-five (n=55) included studies that report employment status outcomes, thirty-six (n=36) were conducted in the United States, with the remaining nineteen (n=19) conducted elsewhere.\nThe results — presented in Figure 14 below — indicate that apprenticeships have a small but significant impact on employment, however they have only been evaluated in the United States. Therefore, it is unclear whether these findings are generalisable to other countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Forest plot depicting the result of subgroup analysis for employment status by study location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Studies conducted in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Studies conducted in other locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.9.3 Study population\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Forest plot depicting the result of subgroup analysis for employment status by study population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Studies involving young people with reported additional barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Studies involving young people without reported additional barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.10 Sensitivity analysis\nThirty (n=30) of the fifty-five (n=55) included studies that report employment status outcomes used randomised study designs, while the remaining twenty-five (n=25) used non-randomised designs.\nThe results of this analysis — presented below in Figure 16 — suggest that the observed overall positive effect of off-the-job training in the additive CNMA may be driven by the larger observed effect sizes in non-randomised studies. The absence of a statistically significant positive effect among randomised studies may be a result of a lack of statistical power — there are fewer randomised than non-randomised studies — it may also reflect a more accurate estimate of effect (i.e., the true effect is that off-the-job training has no impact on employment status) from studies that use designs which generally provide a higher level of confidence.\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Forest plot depicting the result of sensitivity analysis for employment status by study design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Randomised studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Non-randomised studies"
