  abstract = {We study the interaction between job and soft skills training on expectations and labor market outcomes in the context of a youth training program in the Dominican Republic. Program applicants were randomly assigned to one of 3 modalities: a full treatment consisting of hard and soft skills training plus an internship, a partial treatment consisting of soft skills training plus an internship, or a control group. We find strong and lasting effects of the program on personal skills acquisition and expectations, but these results are markedly different for young men and young women. Shortly after completing the program, both male and female participants report increased expectations for improved employment and livelihoods. This result is reversed for male participants in the long run, a result that can be attributed to the program's negative short-run effects on labor market outcomes for males. While these effects seem to dissipate in the long run, employed men are substantially more likely to be searching for another job. On the other hand, women experience improved labor market outcomes in the short run and exhibit substantially higher levels of personal skills in the long run. These results translate into women being more optimistic, having higher self-esteem and lower fertility in the long run. Our results suggest that job-training programs of this type can be transformative -- for women, life skills mattered and made a difference, but they can also have a downside if, like in this case for men, training creates expectations that are not met.},

We use digitized enrollee records from the CCC program in Colorado and New Mexico and matched these records to the 1940 Census, WWII enlistment records, Social Security Administration records, and death certificates. We find that enrollees who spent more time in CCC training grew taller, lived longer lives and had higher lifetime earnings as a result of their participation in the program. We also find modest increases in the educational attainment of the participants and increases in short term geographic mobility. In contrast, we find no evidence that their labor force participation or wages increased in the short run. To assess the internal and external validity of the results, we compare our estimates to those derived from a randomized evaluation of Job Corps, the modern version of the CCC, conducted in the 1990s. The RCT's results show that our empirical strategy delivers estimates that are in line with the experimental estimates. Overall, we find significant long-term benefits in both longevity and earnings, suggesting short and medium-term evaluations underestimate the returns of training programs, as do those that fail to consider effects on longevity.},

  abstract = {Background Globally, 13\% of the youth are not in education, employment or training (NEET). Moreover, this persistent problem has been exacerbated by the shock of Covid-19 pandemic. More youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are likely unemployed than those from better off backgrounds. Thus, the need for increased use of evidence in the design and implementation of youth employment interventions to increase effectiveness and sustainability of interventions and outcomes. Evidence and gap maps (EGMs) can promote evidence-based decision making by guiding policy makers, development partners and researchers to areas with good bodies of evidence and those with little or no evidence. The scope of the Youth Employment EGM is global. The map covers all youth aged 15--35 years. The three broad intervention categories included in the EGM are: strengthening training and education systems, enhancing labour market and, transforming financial sector markets. There are five outcome categories: education and skills; entrepreneurship; employment; welfare and economic outcomes. The EGM contains impact evaluations of interventions implemented to increase youth employment and systematic reviews of such single studies, published or made available between 2000 and 2019. Objectives The primary objective was to catalogue impact evaluations and systematic reviews on youth employment interventions to improve discoverability of evidence by decision makers, development patterners and researchers, so as to promote evidence-based decision making in programming and implementation of youth employment initiatives. Search Methods Twenty databases and websites were searched using a validated search strategy. Additional searches included searching within 21 systematic reviews, snowballing 20 most recent studies and citation tracking of 10 most recent studies included in the EGM. Selection Criteria The study selection criteria followed the PICOS approach of population, intervention, relevant comparison groups, outcomes and study design. Additional criterion is; study publication or availability period of between 2000 and 2021. Only impact evaluations and systematic reviews that included impact evaluations were selected. Data Collection and Analysis A total of 14,511 studies were uploaded in EPPI Reviewer 4 software, upon which 399 were selected using the criteria provided above. Coding of data took place in EPPI Reviewer basing on predefined codes. The unit of analysis for the report is individual studies where every entry represents a combination of interventions and outcomes. Main Results Overall, 399 studies (21 systematic reviews and 378 impact evaluations) are included in the EGM. Impact evaluations (n = 378) are much more than the systematic reviews (n = 21). Most impact evaluations are experimental studies (n = 177), followed by non-experimental matching (n = 167) and other regression designs (n = 35). Experimental studies were mostly conducted in both Lower-income countries and Lower Middle Income countries while non-experimental study designs are the most common in both High Income and Upper Middle Income countries. Most evidence is from low quality impact evaluations (71.2\%) while majority of systematic reviews (71.4\% of 21) are of medium and high quality rating. The area saturated with most evidence is the intervention category of `training', while the underrepresented are three main intervention sub-categories: information services; decent work policies and; entrepreneurship promotion and financing. Older youth, youth in fragility, conflict and violence contexts, or humanitarian settings, or ethnic minorities or those with criminal backgrounds are least studied. Conclusions The Youth Employment EGM identifies trends in evidence notably the following: Most evidence is from high-income countries, an indication of the relationship between a country's income status and research productivity. The most common study designs are experimental. Most of the evidence is of low quality. This finding serves to alert researchers, practitioners and policy makers that more rigorous work is needed to inform youth employment interventions. Blending of interventions is practiced. While this could be an indication that blended intervention could be offering better outcomes, this remains an area with a research gap.},

We argue that computer capital (1) substitutes for workers in performing cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit rules; and (2) complements workers in performing nonroutine problem-solving and complex communications tasks. Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We find that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is associated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nominally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact.},

  abstract = {A recent "revisionist" literature characterizes the pronounced rise in U.S. wage inequality since 1980 as an "episodic" event of the first half of the 1980s driven by nonmarket factors (particularly a falling real minimum wage) and concludes that continued increases in wage inequality since the late 1980s substantially reflect the mechanical confounding effects of changes in labor force composition. Analyzing data from the Current Population Survey for 1963 to 2005, we find limited support for these claims. The slowing of the growth of overall wage inequality in the 1990s hides a divergence in the paths of upper-tail (90/50) inequality--which has increased steadily since 1980, even adjusting for changes in labor force composition--and lower-tail (50/10) inequality, which rose sharply in the first half of the 1980s and plateaued or contracted thereafter. Fluctuations in the real minimum wage are not a plausible explanation for these trends since the bulk of inequality growth occurs above the median of the wage distribution. Models emphasizing rapid secular growth in the relative demand for skills--attributable to skill-biased technical change--and a sharp deceleration in the relative supply of college workers in the 1980s do an excellent job of capturing the evolution of the college/high school wage premium over four decades. But these models also imply a puzzling deceleration in relative demand growth for college workers in the early 1990s, also visible in a recent "polarization" of skill demands in which employment has expanded in high-wage and low-wage work at the expense of middle-wage jobs. These patterns are potentially reconciled by a modified version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis that emphasizes the role of information technology in complementing abstract (high-education) tasks and substituting for routine (middle-education) tasks.},

  abstract = {In this essay, I begin by identifying the reasons that automation has not wiped out a majority of jobs over the decades and centuries.  Automation does indeed substitute for labor---as it is typically intended to do.  However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply.  Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor.  Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay.  In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a "polarization" of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization is unlikely to continue very far into future.  The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth.  I argue that the interplay between machine and human comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.},

To overcome problems of reverse causality---labor market success is not only the result of social capital, but also leads to better networks---the focus is on adolescents who enter the labor market. Data from the `Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey' are used (N\,=\,2574) and matched to register data from Statistics Netherlands. Hypotheses are tested with structural equation models and a longitudinal approach. Two different mechanisms are tested: the capital deficit and the return deficit. Ethnic majority and minority members do not differ in social capital, thus refuting the capital deficit hypothesis. However, for majority members, the upper reachability of their social capital negatively affects chances of unemployment and positively affects chances of having a permanent contract. For minority members, no such effects were observed, indicating that the same level of social capital that benefits majorities, does not benefit minorities. More research into the return deficit minority members face is needed.},

  abstract = {There exists an extensive literature evaluating the effects of public training programs on the employability and earnings of participants. At the same time, such public training programs generally aim to improve the future quality of life of participants. While earnings is an important factor in attaining a better quality of life, there are surely other contributing factors. In this paper, we analyze the causal effect of the availability of a U.S. training program for youth---Job Corps---on future job quality. We define job quality by constructing a linear index that reduces a vector of job characteristics to a scalar quantity. In addition, we separately analyze several important characteristics of jobs. Our job quality index is consistent with the view that workers evaluate a job as a bundle of attributes that have some level of substitutability. Also, since our index is continuous, it permits us to evaluate the distributional impacts of training. Given that the quality of a job is defined only for employed individuals, we solve the selection-into-employment issue by estimating nonparametric bounds on the treatment effects of training for the latent subgroup of individuals that would be employed regardless of treatment assignment (a group that represents 65\% of the population). An advantage of this approach is that it relies on relatively weak assumptions while partially identifying causal effects of training on job quality. We find that Job Corps has significant effects on average quality that are bounded between 10 and 18 percent of a standard deviation in our job quality index. The distributional analysis suggests that the effects are heterogeneous over the distribution of the job quality index. Finally, we also note that effects are heterogeneous across different demographic groups analyzed.},

Abstract In this paper we perform an impact evaluation of the PCPI program, a public sponsored training program for the youth of the Catalonian Employment Service. This program, in its different variants, has the double objective of integrating participants into the labor market as well as re-engaging them back into the formal education system. Using a unique and rich database that combines administrative records from the unemployment office and the social security we apply the matching technique, in order to compare outcomes of participants and and non-participants unemployed individuals with similar observable characteristics. We are able to follow the labor and education outcomes for 3 years after the end of the program. We obtain that none of the variants of the PCPI program has a statistically significant labor impact in the medium term, although they do have a `lock in' effect in the short term. However, both variants of the program are quite effective in reengaging participants back into formal education, although the reengagement is not translated into higher graduation rates.},

With informative data at hand we apply inverse probability weighting, thereby accounting for a dynamic treatment assignment and cyclical availability of programs. Our results indicate positive long-term employment effects for nearly all measures aimed at labor market integration. Measures aimed at integrating youths in apprenticeships are effective in terms of education participation, but fail to show any impact on employment outcomes until the end of our observation period. Public sector job creation is found to be harmful for the medium-term employment prospects and ineffective in the long-run. Our analysis further indicates that the targeting of German ALMP systematically ignores low-educated youths as neediest of labor market groups. While no employment program shows a positive impact on further education participation for any subgroup, the employment impact of participation is often significantly lower for low-educated youths.},

Assuming that the cause of funnel plot asymmetry is likely to affect an entire research field rather than only a particular comparison of interventions, we suggest that network meta-regression is employed to account for small-study effects in a set of related meta-analyses.

  title = {Partial {{Identification}} of {{Average Treatment Effects}} in {{Program Evaluation}}: {{Theory}} and {{Applications}}},
  author = {Chen, Xuan},
  year = {2013},
  address = {Miami, FL},
  abstract = {There has been a recent increase on research focusing on partial identification of average treatment effects in the program evaluation literature. In contrast with traditional point identification, partial identification approaches derive bounds on parameters of interest based on relatively weak assumptions. Thus, they deliver more credible results in empirical applications. This dissertation extends Instrumental Variable (IV) methods in the program evaluation literature by partially identifying treatment effects of interest when evaluating a program or intervention. An influential approach for studying causality within the IV framework was developed by Imbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996). They show that, when allowing for heterogeneous effects, IV estimators point identify the local average treatment effect (LATE) for compliers, whose treatment status is affected by the instrument. This dissertation advances the current IV literature in two important ways. First, inspired by the common criticism that LATE lacks external validity, this dissertation derives sharp nonparametric bounds for population average treatment effects (ATE) within the LATE framework. Second, the dissertation extends the LATE framework to bound treatment effects in the presence of both sample selection and noncompliance. Even when employing randomized experiments to evaluate programs -- as is now common in economics and other social science fields -- assessing the impact of the treatment on outcomes of interest is often made difficult by those two critical identification problems. The sample selection issue arises when outcomes of interest are only observed for a selected group. The noncompliance problem appears because some treatment group individuals do not receive the treatment while some control individuals do. The dissertation addresses both of these identification problems simultaneously and derives nonparametric bounds for average treatment effects within a principal stratification framework. More generally, these bounds can be employed in settings where two identification problems are present and there is a valid instrument to address one of them. The bounds derived in this dissertation are based on two sets of relatively weak assumptions: monotonicity assumptions on potential outcomes within specified subpopulations, and mean dominance assumptions across subpopulations. The dissertation employs the derived bounds to evaluate the effectiveness of the Job Corps (JC) program, which is the largest federally-funded job training program for disadvantaged youth in the United States, with the focus on labor market outcomes and welfare dependence. The dissertation uses data from an experimental evaluation of JC. Individuals were randomly assigned to a treatment group (whose members were allowed to enroll in JC) or to a control group (whose members were denied access to JC for three years). However, there was noncompliance: some individuals who were assigned to participate in JC did not enroll, while some individuals assigned to the control group did. The dissertation addresses this noncompliance issue using random assignment as an IV for enrollment into JC. Concentrating on the population ATE, JC enrollment increases weekly earnings by at least \$24.61 and employment by at least 4.3 percentage points four years after randomization, and decreases yearly dependence on public welfare benefits by at least \$84.29. These bounds are significantly narrower than the ones derived in the current IV literature. The dissertation also evaluates the effect of JC on wages, which are observed only for those who are employed. Hence, the sample selection issue has to be addressed when evaluating this effect. In the presence of sample selection and noncompliance, the average treatment effect of JC enrollment on wages for the always employed compliers, who would comply with their assigned treatment and who would be always employed regardless of their assignment statuses, is bounded between 5.7 percent and 13.9 percent four years after random assignment. The results suggest greater positive average effects of JC on wages than those found in the literature evaluating JC without adjusting for noncompliance. The dissertation closes by pointing out that a similar analytic strategy to the one used in this dissertation can be used to address other problems, for example, to bound the ATE when the instrument does not satisfy the exclusion restriction, and to derive bounds on the part of the effect of a treatment on an outcome that works through a given mechanism (i.e., direct or net effects) in the presence of one identification issue (e.g., noncompliance).},

Inclusion criteria: The review included only experimental and quasi-experimental evaluations which measured the impact of vocational and business training programs in women 18 years and older, in low- and middle-income countries. The review also included qualitative and mixed-methods studies. The review also included studies published in English or Spanish and conducted after 1990 Number of included studies: The review included a total of 35 quantitative studies describing the impact of 30 interventions. The qualitative narrative meta-synthesis included findings on barriers to and facilitators of intervention effectiveness from 50 studies. Context/settings of included studies: Most of the included studies of vocational training took place in Latin America (n=11), with 3 from Africa, 2 from Asia and 2 from the Middle East. The business studies were distributed across the regions of Latin America (n=5), Africa (n=4) and Asia (n=3). The 5 studies examining the impact of the mixed interventions were all conducted in Africa in the countries of C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda. Study findings: Vocational training, on average, had positive but small effects on the employment, formal employment, earnings and income of women in LMIC. On average, vocational training increased the likelihood of employment and formal employment by 11\% (95\% CI=1.03, 1.18, evidence from 8 programmes) and 8\% (95\% CI=1.00, 1.18; evidence from 5 programmes) respectively. The average effect of vocational training on earnings was 5.54\% (95\% Ci=2.5\%, 8.96\%; evidence from 8 programs) or 0.11 standardised mean differences (95\% CI=0.05, 0.18; evidence from 8 programmes). There was no evidence that vocational training programmes that did and did not include life studies training or internships had different effects on employment, though there was some evidence that the effects of vocational training on earnings may increase with the inclusion of life skills training or an internship. Business training combined with cash transfers or life skills training had positive and statistically significant effects on the likelihood of self-employment. On average, business training increased women's sales or profits by 0.10 standardised mean differences (95\% CI=0.00, 0.20; evidence from four programmes).},

The evaluation identified positive impacts of the program on employment and earnings, housing instability, economic hardship, and health and safety. However, the program had no impact on measures of education, social support, criminal behavior and justice system involvement. The study findings provide guidance for future research and program development and raise questions about the appropriateness of traditional models of case management for transition-age youth.},

In both experiments, the program dramatically reduces violent-crime arrests, even after the summer. It does so without improving employment, schooling, or other types of crime; if anything, property crime increases over 2-3 post-program years. To explore mechanisms, we implement a machine learning method that predicts treatment heterogeneity using observables. The method identifies a subgroup of youth with positive employment impacts, whose characteristics differ from the disconnected youth served in most employment programs. We find that employment benefiters commit more property crime than their control counterparts, and non-benefiters also show a decline in violent crime. These results do not seem consistent with typical theory about improved human capital and better labor market opportunities creating a higher opportunity cost of crime, or even with the idea that these programs just keep youth busy. We discuss several alternative mechanisms, concluding that brief youth employment programs can generate substantively important behavioral change, but for different outcomes, different youth, and different reasons than those most often considered in the literature.},

Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial examined two MST-EA Coaching approaches.

In the Vocational Coach condition, (n = 16), MST-EA Coaches delivered the standard skills curricula enhanced with extensive education/employment components. Analyses included pre- to post-treatment comparisons of vocational outcomes, and between groups comparisons of fidelity, satisfaction, and services utilization. Results: Those in the Vocational Coach condition had a twelvefold increase in the odds of posttreatment vocational activity compared to those in the Standard Coach+VR condition (92.9\% vs. 57.1\% employed or in school, respectively). Subgroup analyses of those who engaged in Coaching showed that there was specifically an increase in the odds of post-treatment educational engagement among those in the Vocational Coach condition compared to those in Standard Coach +VR.

Using propensity score matching techniques we find a positive causal effect of the training: one year after the end of the courses the employment rate is about 14 percentage points higher in the treated group compared to the control group. Estimated effects are heterogeneous being more effective the training courses enhancing specialized competencies. Moreover, the impact of the program is higher for younger, short-term unemployed, and those attending longer training courses. The effects do not vanish in the medium term and the results have been proved to be robust to a list of sensitivity checks.},

The usefulness of pairwise meta-analysis is thus limited in real-life medical practice, where many competing interventions may be available for a certain condition and studies informing some of the pairwise comparisons may be lacking. This commonly encountered scenario has led to the development of network meta-analysis (NMA). In the last decade, several applications, methodological developments, and empirical studies in NMA have been published, and the area is thriving as its relevance to public health is increasingly recognized. This article presents a review of the relevant literature on NMA methodology aiming to pinpoint the developments that have appeared in the field.

  abstract = {Network meta-analysis can synthesize evidence from studies comparing multiple treatments for the same disease. Sometimes the treatments of a network are complex interventions, comprising several independent components in different combinations. A component network meta-analysis (CNMA) can be used to analyze such data and can in principle disentangle the individual effect of each component. However, components may interact with each other, either synergistically or antagonistically. Deciding which interactions, if any, to include in a CNMA model may be difficult, especially for large networks with many components. In this article, we present two Bayesian CNMA models that can be used to identify prominent interactions between components. Our models utilize Bayesian variable selection methods, namely the stochastic search variable selection and the Bayesian LASSO, and can benefit from the inclusion of prior information about important interactions. Moreover, we extend these models to combine data from studies providing aggregate information and studies providing individual patient data (IPD). We illustrate our models in practice using three real datasets, from studies in panic disorder, depression, and multiple myeloma. Finally, we describe methods for developing web-applications that can utilize results from an IPD-CNMA, to allow for personalized estimates of relative treatment effects given a patient's characteristics.},

  abstract = {The Youth Training Program (YTP) was an important component of Argentina's active labor policy of the 1990s. The program offered courses of three months' duration, divided equally between lectures and practical experience, and targeted young people, most of whom were not employed and had a low level of education. The program was offered by different institutions chosen through a bidding process and included courses in the fields of agriculture, manufacture, construction and services. This paper conducts an econometric cost-benefit analysis of the fifth round of the YTP. Benefits (wage increases, increase in likelihood of employment, increase in earnings) are estimated using non-matching (Before and After, Cross Section and Difference in Difference) and matching techniques based on propensity score estimate (Nearest Neighbor, Kernel, Local Linear Regression) in order to avoid selection bias. Estimates of the ATE and TT effects are also provided. A sample consisting of 1,670 beneficiaries and a similarly-sized comparison group provided the information necessary to apply the methodology. Benefit estimates are made for the aggregate, by gender and for both youth and adults. Regional differences are also provided. The cost includes direct and indirect components and the alternative cost of beneficiaries reducing their contributions to output during the program. Estimates of rate of return are provided based on the previous benefit and cost estimation. In general, the results support an estimate of 10 percent of return. This looks reasonable if it is compared with the very low rate of return of education estimated separately for the participants group. Finally, the management of the program is evaluated.},

Notable features of BHBF included paid work experiences for youth and the application of external technical assistance in implementing the program model. Objective: The evaluation documented the design and implementation of BHBF and assessed its impacts on outcomes for youth three years after they enrolled in the study. Methods:We randomly assigned 859 youth who were receiving disability payments to either a treatment group that was eligible to receive both BHBF services and waivers of certain disability program rules, or to a control group that was not eligible for either the services or the waivers. Results: Three years after they enrolled in the study, treatment group youth were more likely than youth in the control group to be employed, their earnings were 50 percent higher, and they were less likely to have had contact with the justice system. Conclusion: Interventions that include work experiences as a service component can improve outcomes for youth with disabilities. Empirical monitoring of project staff, combined with technical assistance, may be necessary to ensure a consistent focus on helping youth to find jobs.},

Study Design and Setting Interventions consisted of between one and four components of psychological preparation: procedural information (P), sensory information (S), behavioral instruction (B), cognitive interventions (C), relaxation (R), and emotion-focused techniques (E). We used CNMA models to assess the effect of each component for three outcomes: length of stay, pain, and negative affect. Results We found evidence that the most effective component for reducing length of stay depends on the type of surgery and that R may improve pain. There was insufficient evidence that individual components contributed to the overall reduction in negative affect, but P and S emerged as the most likely beneficial components. Overall, we were unable to identify any one component as the most effective across all three outcomes. Conclusion The CNMA method allowed us to address questions about the effects of specific components that could not be answered using standard Cochrane methodology.},

  abstract = {The policy of unemployment is probably one of the most controversial issues among economists, social scientists and politicians. In this article, we argue that European regions with higher levels of social capital will tend to have lower levels of unemployment. Using a macro-quantitative cross-sectional analysis of 134 European regions, we show that a great deal of variability in sub-national unemployment rates can be accounted for by a particular level of regionally aggregated measures of the density and depth of social networks between individuals. In other words, higher levels of social capital will lead to more efficient use of information about the labour market, to lower search and transaction costs on both sides of the market, to a higher quality of applicants, to the efficient placement of individual workers, to less conflict between insiders and outsiders and to more intensive efforts to find work. All in all, higher levels of social capital can be expected to limit the numbers of unemployed. Even when applying simultaneous equation modelling to counter against a possible endogeneity problem, our findings remain robust.},

  abstract = {The effects of a job training program, Job Corps, on both employment and wages are evaluated using data from a randomized study. Principal stratification is used to address, simultaneously, the complications of noncompliance, wages that are only partially defined because of nonemployment, and unintendedmissing outcomes. The first two complications are of substantive interest, whereas the third is a nuisance. The objective is to find a parsimonious model that can be used to inform public policy. We conduct a likelihood-based analysis using finite mixture models estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We maintain an exclusion restriction assumption for the effect of assignment on employment and wages for noncompliers, but not on missingness. We provide estimates under the "missing at random" assumption, and assess the robustness of our results to deviations from it. The plausibility of meaningful restrictions is investigated by means of scaled log-likelihood ratio statistics. Substantive conclusions include the following. For compliers, the effect on employment is negative in the short term; it becomes positive in the long term, but these effects are small at best. For always employed compliers, that is, compliers who are employed whether trained or not trained, positive effects on wages are found at all time periods. Our analysis reveals that background characteristics of individuals differ markedly across the principal strata. We found evidence that the program should have been better targeted, in the sense of being designed differently for different groups of people, and specific suggestions are offered. Previous analyses of this dataset, which did not address all complications in a principled manner, led to less nuanced conclusions about Job Corps. {\copyright} 2012 American Statistical Association.},

  abstract = {Frank Furstenberg examines how the newly extended timetable for entering adulthood is affecting, and being affected by, the institution of the Western, particularly the American, family. He reviews a growing body of research on the family life of young adults and their parents and draws out important policy implications of the new schedule for the passage to adulthood. Today, says Furstenberg, home-leaving, marriage, and the onset of childbearing take place much later in the life span than they did during the period after World War II. After the disappearance of America's well-paying unskilled and semi-skilled manufacturing jobs during the 1960s, youth from all economic strata began remaining in school longer and marrying and starting their own families later. Increasing numbers of lower-income women did not marry at all but chose, instead, non-marital parenthood---often turning to their natal families for economic and social support, rather than to their partners. As the period of young adult's dependence on their families grew longer, the financial and emotional burden of parenthood grew heavier. Today, regardless of their income level, U.S. parents provide roughly the same proportion of their earnings to support their young adult children. Unlike many nations in Europe, the United States, with its relatively underdeveloped welfare system, does not invest heavily in education, health care, and job benefits for young adults. It relies, instead, on families' investments in their own adult children. But as the transition to adulthood becomes more protracted, the increasing family burden may prove costly to society as a whole. Young adults themselves may begin to regard childbearing as more onerous and less rewarding. The need to provide greater support for children for longer periods may discourage couples from having additional children or having children at all. Such decisions could lead to lower total fertility, ultimately reduce the workforce, and further aggravate the problem of providing both for increasing numbers of the elderly and for the young. U.S. policy makers must realize the importance of reinforcing the family nest and helping reduce the large and competing demands that are being placed on today's parents.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To develop methods guidance to support the conduct of rapid reviews (RRs) produced within Cochrane and beyond, in response to requests for timely evidence syntheses for decision-making purposes including urgent health issues of high priority. Study Design and Setting: Interim recommendations were informed by a scoping review of the underlying evidence, primary methods studies conducted, and a survey sent to 119 representatives from 20 Cochrane entities, who were asked to rate and rank RR methods across stages of review conduct. Discussions among those with expertise in RR methods further informed the list of recommendations with accompanying rationales provided. Results: Based on survey results from 63 respondents (53\% response rate), 26 RR methods recommendations are presented for which there was a high or moderate level of agreement or scored highest in the absence of such agreement. Where possible, how recommendations align with Cochrane methods guidance for systematic reviews is highlighted. Conclusion: The Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group offers new, interim guidance to support the conduct of RRs. Because best practice is limited by the lack of currently available evidence for some RR methods shortcuts taken, this guidance will need to be updated as additional abbreviated methods are evaluated. {\'O} 2020 The Author(s).

  abstract = {The Los Angeles Economic and Workforce Development Department (EWDD) created the Los Angeles Reconnections Career Academy (LARCA) program as a means of addressing the extensive education and employment needs of the city's sizable out-of-school youth population. Funded by a \$12 million Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) grant from the U.S. Department of Labor, the LARCA program provided chronically absent and dropout youth, ages 16 to 24, with education, training and employment services, alongside case management and other supportive services, using a career pathways model. The program operated from 2013 to 2015 and served over 1,000 youth. To evaluate the LARCA program, EWDD contracted with Social Policy Research Associates (SPR). This report presents the findings from the evaluation's random assignment impact study and cost study. Using administrative data from multiple state and local agencies, the impact study found that LARCA program participants re-enrolled in secondary and postsecondary education, and earned secondary education credentials and college credit at a higher rate than did control group members for up to two years after the point of random assignment. While the evaluation did not find impacts on employment, a longer follow-up period may have yielded different results. The report also presents the findings from the evaluation's cost study and costeffectiveness analysis, which found that the LARCA program spent more per participant to achieve the gains it produced than was spent on the WIA services that were available to the control group. These findings are likely due to LARCA being a new program with higher start-up and infrastructure costs as well as the evaluation's relatively short follow-up window in which to observe program impacts. Overall, the findings in this report contribute to the knowledge base of what works for out-ofschool youth, especially given that the LARCA program showed positive impacts in a city where the workforce system prioritizes out-of-school youth and offers a rich array of services that control group youth could easily access. This evaluation helps inform how to serve this population, and, more specifically, to address the increased emphasis placed on serving out-ofschool youth under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).},

CTE participants rated themselves better prepared in what to expect at the job and knowing technical information about the job than non-participants. Unexpectedly, interns had lower state-reported total earnings and number of quarters worked than non-interns. Interns rated themselves as equally prepared as non-interns in general work skills.

After a thorough selection and quality appraisal of the studies, 29 studies focusing on job and identity explorations were selected. Results show that emerging adults expect to hold different jobs after graduating and indications were found that job mobility does take place in this period.

Intervention(s): The program included a multi-disciplinary vocational rehabilitation intervention for young people with physical disabilities. In a community setting, a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation team delivered the Family Employment Awareness Training program to youth with disabilities such as autism, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy. One-on-one mentoring was part of the Back on Track program. The goal of the Adolescent Employment Readiness Center was to assist youth with disabilities in improving their quality of life and employment readiness outcomes during their early adolescence. Study questions: Our objectives are two-fold: (1) learning how work place intervention can affect skills and work outcome for young people (ages 15-25 years) with physical handicaps; and (2) learning about the common vocations in young people with physical handicaps. Inclusion criteria: The study included (1) an intentional vocational program (or intervention) (i.e., designed to assist young people with physical disabilities to gain jobs or professional education); (2) a sample of at least 50 percent of youth (aged 15,225) acquired, or conducted by a peer reviewing journal, a dissertation or a conference paper published in 1990 and January 2014; (3) (defined as a physical functional limitation, such as spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, congenital disorder, amputation, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, neuromuscular disease, scoliosis, movement disorder, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, or stroke). Number of included studies: 8 Context/settings of included studies: Two of the studies were carried out in the Netherlands, while the other six were carried out in the United States. The study's sample size ranged from 10 to 108 participants. Five studies used pre-post designs, two used mixed methods, and one used a quasi-experimental design. Study findings: After participating in a vocational program, the majority of participants gained unpaid or paid employment in six of the eight studies reviewed.

  abstract = {This paper considers whether it is possible to devise a nonexperimental procedure for evaluating a prototypical job training programme. Using rich nonexperimental data, we examine the performance of a two-stage evaluation methodology that (a) estimates the probability that a person participates in a programme and (b) uses the estimated probability in extensions of the classical method of matching. We decompose the conventional measure of programme evaluation bias into several components and find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important than other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction of the estimated programme impact. Matching methods applied to comparison groups located in the same labour markets as participants and administered the same questionnaire eliminate much of the bias as conventionally measured, but the remaining bias is a considerable fraction of experimentally-determined programme impact estimates. We test and reject the identifying assumptions that justify the classical method of matching. We present a nonparametric conditional difference-in-differences extension of the method of matching that is consistent with the classical index-sufficient sample selection model and is not rejected by our tests of identifying assumptions. This estimator is effective in eliminating bias, especially when it is due to temporally-invariant omitted variables.},

These findings provided justification for Congress to cut the budget of JTPA's youth component by over 80 percent. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of the experimental impact estimates along several dimensions of construction and interpretation. We find that the statistical significance of the male youth estimates is extremely fragile and that the magnitudes of the estimates for both youth groups are sensitive to nearly all the factors we consider. In particular, accounting for experimental control group members who substitute training from other providers leads to a much more positive picture regarding the effectiveness of JTPA classroom training. Our study indicates the value of sensitivity analyses in experimental evaluations and illustrates that experimental impact estimates, like those from nonexperimental analyses, require careful interpretation if they are to provide a reliable guide to policymakers.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses that simultaneously compare multiple treatments (usually referred to as network meta-analyses or mixed treatment comparisons) are becoming increasingly common. An important component of a network meta-analysis is an assessment of the extent to which different sources of evidence are compatible, both substantively and statistically. A simple indirect comparison may be confounded if the studies involving one of the treatments of interest are fundamentally different from the studies involving the other treatment of interest. Here, we discuss methods for addressing inconsistency of evidence from comparative studies of different treatments. We define and review basic concepts of heterogeneity and inconsistency, and attempt to introduce a distinction between `loop inconsistency' and `design inconsistency'. We then propose that the notion of design-by-treatment interaction provides a useful general framework for investigating inconsistency. In particular, using design-by-treatment interactions successfully addresses complications that arise from the presence of multi-arm trials in an evidence network. We show how the inconsistency model proposed by Lu and Ades is a restricted version of our full design-by-treatment interaction model and that there may be several distinct Lu--Ades models for any particular data set. We introduce novel graphical methods for depicting networks of evidence, clearly depicting multi-arm trials and illustrating where there is potential for inconsistency to arise. We apply various inconsistency models to data from trials of different comparisons among four smoking cessation interventions and show that models seeking to address loop inconsistency alone can run into problems.

  abstract = {This study estimates the net impacts and private and social benefits and costs of nine workforce development programs administered in Washington State. Five of the programs serve job-ready adults: Community and Technical College Job Training, Private Career Schools, Apprenticeships, Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) Title III programs, and Community and Technical College Worker Retraining. Two of the programs serve adults with employment barriers: Community and Technical College Adult Basic Skills Education and JTPA Title II-A programs. The other two programs serve youth: JTPA Title II-C programs and Secondary Career Technical Education. The net impact analyses were conducted using a nonexperimental methodology. Individuals who encountered the workforce development programs were statistically matched to individuals who did not. Administrative data with information from the universe of program participants and Employment Service registrants (who served as the comparison group pool) supported the analyses. These data included over 10 years of pre-program and outcome information including demographics, employment and earnings information from the Unemployment Insurance wage record system, and transfer income information such as Food Stamp and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipiency and benefits. A variety of estimation techniques were used to calculate net impacts including comparison of means, regression-adjusted comparison of means, and difference-in-difference comparison of means. We estimated short-run net impacts that examined outcomes for individuals who exited from the education or training programs (or from the employment service) in the fiscal year 1999/2000 and longer-run impacts for individuals who exited in the fiscal year 1997/98. Short-run employment impacts a re positive for seven of the nine programs and negative for the other two. Short-run earnings impacts are insignificant for four of the programs, negative for two, and positive for the remaining three. The longer-run impacts are more sanguine. Employment impacts are positive for all nine programs, and earnings are positive for seven and insignificantly different from zero for the other two. The benefit-cost analyses show that all of the programs have discounted future benefits that far exceed the costs for participants, and that society also receives a positive return on investment.},

The implementation strategy is analyzed using various policy documents. The findings indicate that the program is apparently targeted at those groups of young people who are less disadvantaged as regards education level and previous unemployment experience. At the same time, paradoxically, the effects in terms of outflows from the unemployment register are weak for the short-term and medium-term unemployed, as well as for low-skilled and high-skilled youth, and stronger effects are evident in the case of long-term unemployed and medium-skilled youth. The failures in targeting and in adjusting the program to the needs of more vulnerable groups of youth are due to an inconsistent implementation strategy of Czech Public Employment Services.},

The paper analyzes the impact of the program on traditional labor market outcomes and on outcomes related to youth behavior and life style, expectations about the future and socio-emotional skills. In terms of labor market outcomes, the program has a positive impact on job formality for men of about 17 percent and there is also a seven percent increase in monthly earnings among those employed. However, there are no overall impacts on employment rates. Regarding non-labor market outcomes, the program reduces teenage pregnancy by five percentage points in the treatment group (about 45 percent), which is consistent with an overall increase in youth expectations about the future. The program also has a positive impact on non-cognitive skills as measured by three different scales. Scores improve between 0.08 and 0.16 standard deviations with the program. Although recent progress noted in the literature suggests that socio-emotional skills increase employability and quality of employment, the practical significance of the impacts is unclear, as there is only weak evidence that the life skills measures used are associated to better labor market performance. This is an area of growing interest and relevance that requires further research. JEL codes: J24, J64, O15, O17.},

Inclusion criteria: The study included studies published between January 1990 and July 2018. The study included studies that targeted young adults with chronic disabling health conditions including mental health, intellectual/learning, physical or speech/hearing/visual disability. Number of included studies: 5,816 articles were identified and of these, 10 were relevant for the qualitative synthesis Context/settings of included studies: All the 10 studies were from High Income Countries, with 6 from the USA, 2 from Australia, one from the UK and the other from Australia. Study findings: The interventions in the included studies were tailored supported employment (SE) (n=8), Tailored SE in combination with a disease-specific work intervention (SE+) (n=2), Tailored SE in combination with self-disclosure training (n=1), Youth transition demonstration (YTD) enhanced employment (n=1) and Technology-based job interviewing training (n=1). Eight of the 10 studies examined the impact of the intervention on competitive employment. Three studies also assessed employment in any job as the outcome, some studies looked at job tenure, employment income and hours worked. There was a strong evidence for SE on competitive employment. Moderate evidence was available for the effect of SE on employment in any job. Insufficient evidence was identified for the use of other interventions including SE+, SE and self-disclosure training, YTD and technology-based job interviewing training. A moderate level of evidence existed for the use of SE to support competitive employment for young adults with mental health conditions. There was not enough evidence to support the use of SE for competitive employment for young adults with mental health conditions and other disabling health conditions.},

For the purpose of assisting a successful transition of foster care youth to adulthood, states provide Independent Living Services (ILS) with federal funding support. This study aims to test ILS's effects on educational attainment and employment of foster care youth. We employ multi-state data sources: the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Outcome survey, NYTD service files, and the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, collected from foster youth (N = 4206). The dependent variables are high school completion, post-secondary education, and full-time employment measured at age 21. The independent variable is any ILS use in the following areas during the ages of 17--18: academic support, career preparation, employment or vocational training, mentoring, or education financial assistance. Propensity Score Matching was used to adjust for potential selection bias and pre-existing differences in observation data between youth who received and did not receive ILS. The weighted logistic regression analyses show that foster youth using ILS are significantly more likely to complete high school education (Odds Ratio = 1.25, p =.03), have a post-secondary education (Odds Ratio = 1.20, p =.03), and work full-time (Odds Ratio = 1.24, p =.04) in emerging adulthood. We discuss the gaps and challenges in current research that estimates ILS effects. The findings suggest that it is critical to fully implement these services, explore approaches for providing more complete and equitable access, and continue work that further explicates key factors in receipt and effectiveness of ILS for transition-aged youth.},

  abstract = {The youth of today represent a vast potential for inclusive growth and development. If youth are given the opportunity to build appropriate skills and access decent employment, they can help to accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and engage in meaningful work that benefits them, their families and society as a whole.{\textbackslash}r Unfortunately, decent jobs are not a feasible prospect for all young women and men. Today, over 73 million young people are unemployed worldwide. Youth unemployment stands at a much higher level than the average unemployment rate for adults, in some cases over three times as high. Moreover, two out of five young people in the labour force are either working but poor or unemployed. The youth employment challenge is therefore not only about job creation, but also -- and especially -- about enhancing the quality of jobs for youth.{\textbackslash}r Youth's gloomy prospects in the labour market embody a massive waste of potential and a threat to social cohesion. Understanding what works to improve their labour market outcomes is therefore of paramount importance and a development priority for all countries and regions.},

To assess whether these interventions have succeeded in improving young people's labor market outcomes, this study systematically and quantitatively reviews 113 impact evaluations of youth employment programs worldwide. Of a total of 3105 effect estimates we extract from these studies, one-third are positive significant. The unconditional average effect size across all programs is small, both for employment-related outcomes (Hedges' g\,=\,0.05, SE\,=\,0.02) and earnings-related outcomes (Hedges' g\,=\,0.04, SE\,=\,0.02). We analyze correlates of success in a meta-regression framework. We find that (i) programs are more successful in middle- and low-income countries; (ii) the intervention type is less important than design and delivery; (iii) programs integrating multiple services are more successful; (iv) profiling of beneficiaries, individualized follow-up systems and incentives for services providers matter; and (v) impacts are of larger magnitude in the long-term. Some of these findings provide new and important insights about the design and delivery of interventions, whereas others confirm those of previous reviews. Ultimately, our findings provide practitioners with an improved evidence base about how certain design features contribute to successful youth employment programs in different contexts.},

One of steps taken towards decreasing it by the European Union has been the program Youth Guarantee, implemented by a number of member states. Despite the relatively lower youth unemployment, the Czech Republic has implemented this program as well, and supported the realization of the project Internships for Young Job Seekers, whose aim was to ease the transition for students from schools to the labour market thanks to internships in companies. The effects which internship related project bring for their participants have been evaluated in other EU countries, mainly in Germany, but also in Sweden or France. However, evidence about internships' effectiveness has been missing for the Czech Republic, and this paper fills this existing knowledge gap with the use of counterfactual impact evaluation methods. In the paper, we have focused on examining the impacts of internships on personal income and economic status of trainees by using the propensity score matching, difference-in-differences estimation and two complementary methods -- ordinary least squares and multinomial logit. The results confirmed a positive impact of internships on treated project participants regarding both outcome variables, and thus, are consistent with the majority of literature in the field.},

  abstract = {Background: In network meta-analyses, several treatments can be compared by connecting evidence from clinical trials that have investigated two or more treatments. The resulting trial network allows estimating the relative effects of all pairs of treatments taking indirect evidence into account. For a valid analysis of the network, consistent information from different pathways is assumed. Consistency can be checked by contrasting effect estimates from direct comparisons with the evidence of the remaining network. Unfortunately, one deviating direct comparison may have side effects on the network estimates of others, thus producing hot spots of inconsistency. Methods: We provide a tool, the net heat plot, to render transparent which direct comparisons drive each network estimate and to display hot spots of inconsistency: this permits singling out which of the suspicious direct comparisons are sufficient to explain the presence of inconsistency. We base our methods on fixed-effects models. For disclosure of potential drivers, the plot comprises the contribution of each direct estimate to network estimates resulting from regression diagnostics. In combination, we show heat colors corresponding to the change in agreement between direct and indirect estimate when relaxing the assumption of consistency for one direct comparison. A clustering procedure is applied to the heat matrix in order to find hot spots of inconsistency. Results: The method is shown to work with several examples, which are constructed by perturbing the effect of single study designs, and with two published network meta-analyses. Once the possible sources of inconsistencies are identified, our method also reveals which network estimates they affect. Conclusion: Our proposal is seen to be useful for identifying sources of inconsistencies in the network together with the interrelatedness of effect estimates. It opens the way for a further analysis based on subject matter considerations.},

Wage rates are only observed for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest. Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition. {\copyright} 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

Drawing on data from the first six waves of Understanding Society, the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009--2014), the analysis shows that ethnic minority members, particularly black African, black Caribbean, Pakistani and Bangladeshi minorities, face much higher risks of unemployment and have much lower levels of earnings than do their white British counterparts over the life course. Ethnic minorities are not only more likely to face unemployment, previous experiences of unemployment also carry more enduring scars for them than for the majority group in terms of reemployment and pay. Even with similar levels of prior unemployment, ethnic minorities are more susceptible to delayed re-entry and wage penalties than are their white British peers. The life-course trajectories in unemployment and lower pay, coupled with unemployment scarring, suggest cumulative ethnic disadvantages in the UK.},

The purpose of this study was to understand the relationships between race, ethnicity and school and work outcomes for youth with disabilities. We conducted a scoping review while searching eight international databases that identified 49 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Of the 49 studies that were included in the review, they involved youth and young adults with disabilities (aged 6--29) over a 21-year period. The majority of the studies focusing on school showed that ethnic minority youth with disabilities had poorer school outcomes compared to white youth with disabilities. Meanwhile, most studies focusing on work reported that ethnic minority youth with a disability had worse employment outcomes compared to white disabled youth. Factors influencing school and work included cultural differences in expectations, inequitable access to services and resources, and discrimination. Our findings highlight the disparities that exist for young people with disabilities from ethnic minority backgrounds. There is an urgent need for further research to understand their lived experiences to help address gaps in school and work outcomes.Implications for rehabilitationClinicians and educators should help to provide ethnic minority youth with equitable resources and opportunities to help them achieve their school and career goals.Clinicians and educators should consider participating in culturally sensitive care training to better understand the different needs and experiences of ethnic minority youth with disabilities.Clinicians and educators should try to work collectively with parents and ethnic minority youth with disabilities to optimize their transition outcomes.

Researchers found that implementation was strong, but program impacts were less impressive. While SCEP's participants got summer jobs at a substantially higher rate (92\%) than the control group (62\%), the program's ability to translate this large and immediate summer employment impact into intermediate gains (in terms of future plans, college enrollment, work success, sense of self-efficacy or reduced criminal activity) proved to be negligible. Although impacts were short lived, the report concludes that SCEP and similar programs have an important place in the larger mosaic of supports, programs and opportunities for young people.

  abstract = {Overview High  school  dropouts  face  an  uphill  battle  in  a  labor  market  that  increasingly  rewards  skills  and  postsecondary credentials: they are more likely than their peers to need public assistance, be arrested or  incarcerated,  and  less  likely  to  marry.  This  report presents  results  from  a  rigorous  evaluation  of  the  National  Guard  Youth  Challenge  Program,  an  intensive  residential  program  that  aims  to  ``reclaim  the  lives  of  at-risk  youth''  who  have  dropped  out.  More  than  100,000  young  people  have  completed the program since it was launched in the early 1990s. MDRC is conducting the evaluation in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood.  The  17-month  Challenge  program  is  divided  into  three phases:  Pre-Challenge,  a  two-week  orientation  and  assessment  period;  a  20-week  Residential  Phase;  and  a  one-year  Post-residential  Phase  featuring  a  mentoring  program.  During  the  first  two  phases,  participants  live  at  the  program  site, often on a military base. The environment is ``quasi-military,'' though there are no requirements for military service. The evaluation uses a random assignment design. Because there were more qualified applicants than slots,  a  lottery-like  process  was  used  to  decide  which  applicants  were  admitted  to  the  program.  Those who were admitted (the program group) are being compared over time with those who were not admitted (the control group); any significant differences that emerge between the groups can be attributed to Challenge. About 3,000 young people entered the study in 10 Challenge programs in 2005-2006.},

This reality poses a particular challenge for out-of-school youth, who are no longer connected to institutions designed to provide them with training and connect them to good jobs. The Center for Employment Training (CET) in San Jose, California, is one such institution. CET in San Jose, with its training in a work like setting and involvement of local employers, showed promise as a program for youth, having produced large positive effects on their employment and earnings in two earlier studies in the late 1980s. Based on these earlier results, the U.S. Department of Labor launched the Evaluation of the Center for Employment Training Replication Sites in the mid-1990s, which was designed to test whether the CET model could be implemented successfully in different settings and have similarly positive effects on the youth served. This final report on the evaluation summarizes the replication effort's success and effects on youth after four and a half years. It shows that, even in the sites that best implemented the model, CET had no overall employment and earnings effects for youth in the program, even though it increased participants' hours of training and receipt of credentials.

We first describe how to make the preregistration as thorough as possible---and how to handle deviations from the plan. We then focus on creating easy-to-read materials (e.g., search syntax, R scripts) to facilitate reproducibility and bolster the impact of a meta-analysis. Finally, we suggest how to organize data (e.g., literature search results, data extracted from studies) that are easy to share, interpret, and update as new studies emerge. For each step of the meta-analysis, we provide example templates, accompanied by brief video tutorials, and show how to integrate these practices into the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/q8stz/).

Network theories of social capital argue that well-connected workers benefit because of the job information and influence they receive through their social ties. Although a number of studies have found a positive relationship between measures of social capital and wages and/or occupational prestige, little is known about the causal effect of social networks on labor market outcomes. Four data sets are used to reassess findings on the role of social capital in the labor market. A test of causality is proposed based on the argument that if social capital variables do have a causal effect on job outcomes, then workers with high levels of social capital should be more likely to use contacts to find work, all else being equal. Results suggest that much of the effect of social capital in the existing literature reflects the tendency for similar people to become friends rather than a causal effect of friends' characteristics on labor market outcomes.},

This estimator let us conclude that, for participants, the time needed to find a job is reduced in 471 days. The second one is the differences estimator, it let us conclude that the time needed to find a job is reduced in 448 days. The evaluated program works as an active labour market policy with favourable effects on unemployed young people. Compared with other research in Spain, the obtained results show evidence in the same way as most of evaluation but stronger.

  abstract = {Foster youth in the U.S. often face a multitude of adverse outcomes, including low educational attainment, elevated rates of adult poverty, and disproportionately high levels of adult homelessness. One newer area of social policy research and advocacy, asset building, may help explain some of these disparities. Foster youth face several barriers to asset building. For example, many youth have several placements during their stay in care, resulting in youth receiving inconsistent schooling, mentoring, and support, and facing limited opportunities to work, save money, or build academic and professional networks. This paper examines the frequency with which transition-age foster youth receive asset building services and whether the youth who receive services experience improved outcomes compared to those who do not. Analyzing data from the National Youth in Transition Database and using a Propensity Score Matching methodology, this study finds that youth receiving Budgeting and Financial Education Services and Post-Secondary Education Services experience significantly improved outcomes, including reduced likelihood of homelessness and increased likelihood of employment and educational enrollment. However, only 29\% of youth receive Budgeting and Financial Education Services, and only 19\% of youth receive Post-Secondary Education Services. Service receipt also covaries with demographics, including race/ethnicity and education level. These findings have noteworthy implications for both policy and practice as asset building for foster youth is a potentially promising realm for public service expansion.},

Initially, we present an index of on-the-job human capital acquisition (OJHCA) based on data from the OECD program for international assessment of adult competencies. The data shows a positive relationship between the on-the-job training and on-the-job learning indexes and a strong positive correlation between the human capital index and employment rates across OECD economies. Next, we build a search and matching model that hinges on the training provided by firms as well as workers' learning. The model also includes education along with taxes that increase and decrease human capital investments. We calibrate the model to the United Kingdom and analyze the role of taxes and education to explain the variation in human capital acquired on-the-job, employment and productivity across countries. We also obtain the marginal costs in every country that reproduce the levels of on-the-job human capital as observed in the data. The model is almost able to reproduce the observed differences in employment rates between the groups of countries in the highest and lowest tertiles of the OJHCA distribution, and OJHCA accounts for forty percent of the simulated employment differences. Finally, we analyze subsidies to training costs and conclude that a 10\% reduction in marginal training cost increases long-term employment by almost 0.5 percentage points.},

In contrast, the new NLSY (NLSY97)offers researchers opportunities to analyze direct evidence on school-to-work programs. In theNLSY97, individuals are asked a set of survey questions about "programs schools offer to help students prepare for the world of work," and an accompanying survey includes information on school-to-work programs offered by schools attended by the interviewees. These data, coupled with observations on multiple individuals in the same schools, potentially allow researchers to estimate the effects of school-to-work programs on individuals while accounting for possible bias from selection into these programs, although apparent data problems pose some limitations. Because Round One of the NLSY97 covers workers only up to age 17, this paper focuses on the consequences of school-to-work programs for youth employment and schooling decisions while in high school, and students' subjective assessments of the likelihood of future schooling and work behavior. Overall, the evidence does not point to a causal effect of school-to-work program participation on behavior likely associated with future college attendance. On the other hand, school-to-work program participation does appear to have positive effects on educational attainment in terms of respondents' subjective probabilities of obtaining a high-school diploma. More in accordance with the traditional view of school-to-work programs, the data indicate that participation in these programs increases the perceived likelihood of future labor market activity, both for the year following the survey and at age 30. However, school-to-work programs do not appear to boost the probability of current employment.},

  abstract = {Active labour market policies (ALMPs) that connect people to good jobs will help to promote an equitable and sustained recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Labour demand measures have been vital to preserve jobs in the short term and countries have begun to implement a suite of training programmes for displaced workers. Getting the correct balance of ALMPs is essential for ensuring an effective use of resources that reach, the people in need, including those most at risk of permanent detachment from the labour market and respond well to their needs. This policy brief highlights how OECD countries and a number of other countries have responded to the crisis in adapting and expanding the suite of ALMPs that they offer to prepare for an inclusive recovery. Designing active labour market policies for the recovery 2 {\textbar} DESIGNING ACTIVE LABOUR MARKET POLICIES FOR THE RECOVERY {\copyright} OECD 2021 Key messages and policy options {$\bullet$} The set of active labour market policies (ALMPs) that countries offer should be flexible and responsive, to allow quick and proportionate reactions to economic shocks. Policies that stimulate labour demand can prevent excessive unemployment that may hinder the recovery. This allows greater headway to focus on reorientation towards training policies that can help economies reallocate labour to support economic restructuring. {$\bullet$} During the pandemic, OECD and EU countries scaled up and introduced measures to support the demand for labour through employment incentives, such as hiring subsidies and social security waivers. This has been particularly useful in the crisis time to limit the jobs fallout, complement short-time work schemes and prevent detachment of people from the labour market. In line with the evidence that targeting of these measures can increase their effectiveness, many countries targeted their new measures on young people, long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, older unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. As economies start to recover, countries should scale back public works programmes and target employment incentives more tightly. {$\bullet$} Recognising that training will be vital to match workers to jobs in the short-and long-run, countries have augmented training offers during the pandemic to support reallocation of workers and to upskill those at risk of displacement. At the same time, the training offer has been adapted to the COVID-situation, with 76\% of OECD and EU countries moving training online and 70\% introducing new online courses, while 28\% have also funded additional places in institutional training. {$\bullet$} Special emphasis has been placed on training in the use of digital tools. The crisis has shown that digitalisation can increase resilience and preserve capacity in the face of stringent restrictions to physical interaction. To make digital service provision more inclusive going forward, further efforts are needed to ensure that all individuals have the skills and access to technology needed to benefit from these services. {$\bullet$} With a full labour market recovery still far off in many countries, it is crucial to ensure that ALMPs are effective, reach the people in need and respond well to their needs. Evaluating the impact of the measures introduced or redesigned during the pandemic is essential to promote cost-effectiveness. Countries should continue their efforts to integrate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in their policy making process.},

We used the difference-in-difference method to examine the effectiveness of the program while controlling for both observed and unobserved characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups. We focused on the two primary outcomes of the program: (1) intention to find a job and (2) probability of being not in employment, education, or training (NEET). The analysis results show that the intention of the program participants to find a job increased to 8.3\% compared to that of non-participants during the three-year program period. We also found the positive effect of the program on reducing the risk of NEET. The probability of being NEET of the program participants decreased to 6.6\% more compared to non-participants during the three-year period. We provide discussion of the possible policy implications and limitations of this study.},

To address the issue, we have resorted to a counterfactual approach with data from two main sources: the program administration and compulsory communications on employment and unemployment spells. We found a net impact of +5pp on average; we found positive effects for on-the-job training, but no impact for off-the-job training. On-the-job training also affects the probability to find permanent work (+3pp). This is consistent with the view that young people have excellent theoretical, but very little work-related competences. Off-the-job training does affect the probability to experience at least one labor contract after 2016. These results are partly due to a lock-in effect, namely the tendency of those who attend training programs to delay their job search. Interestingly, we found that the program has a different impact for different typologies of recipients and different types of intervention. In a nutshell, active labor policy works when it generates work-related competences.},

It is therefore important both theoretically and clinically to examine whether specific components of CBT or their combinations are superior to others in the treatment of panic disorder. Component network meta-analysis (NMA) is an extension of standard NMA that can be used to disentangle the treatment effects of different components included in composite interventions. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central, with supplementary searches of reference lists and clinical trial registries, for all randomized controlled trials comparing different CBT-based psychological therapies for panic disorder with each other or with control interventions. We applied component NMA to disentangle the treatment effects of different components included in these interventions. After reviewing 2526 references, we included 72 studies with 4064 participants. Interoceptive exposure and face-to-face setting were associated with better treatment efficacy and acceptability. Muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure were associated with significantly lower efficacy. Components such as breathing retraining and in vivo exposure appeared to improve treatment acceptability while having small effects on efficacy. The comparison of the most v. the least efficacious combination, both of which may be provided as 'evidence-based CBT,' yielded an odds ratio for the remission of 7.69 (95\% credible interval: 1.75 to 33.33). Effective CBT packages for panic disorder would include face-to-face and interoceptive exposure components, while excluding muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure.},

The author study if inequalities have changed after the economic crisis, once youth policies designed to improve the Spanish school-to-work transition (SWT) system were implemented. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on microdata from the Spanish Survey on Income and Living Conditions, the paper compares the probability of becoming not in employment, education or training (NEET) of young men and women born inside or outside Spain and living in different types of households. Findings Although unemployment rates have improved since the end of the crisis, the situation regarding youth employment, poverty and inequalities remains challenging. Gender and other structural differences are usually ignored in policy debates and in the measures adopted to fight youth unemployment, leading to the persistance of inequalities. Research limitations/implications The analysis illustrates new lines and trajectories in the segmentation of youth labor markets along the lines of gender, household and country of origin. Practical implications The findings highlight the need for introducing an analysis of the different sources of vulnerability in policy designs in order to promote a real and sustainable change in SWTs. Originality/value The contribution of this research to the literature on NEET and SWT is to introduce a framework that allows for the intersectional analysis of gender and other structural inequalities.},

In standard NMA, all existing (single or combined) treatments are different nodes in the network. However, sometimes an alternative model is of interest that utilizes the information that some treatments are combinations of common components, called component network meta-analysis (CNMA) model. The additive CNMA model assumes that the effect of a treatment combined of two components A and B is the sum of the effects of A and B, which is easily extended to treatments composed of more than two components. This implies that in comparisons equal components cancel out. Interaction CNMA models also allow interactions between the components. Bayesian analyses have been suggested. We report an implementation of CNMA models in the frequentist R package netmeta. All parameters are estimated using weighted least squares regression. We illustrate the application of CNMA models using an NMA of treatments for depression in primary care. Moreover, we show that these models can even be applied to disconnected networks, if the composite treatments in the subnetworks contain common components.},

  abstract = {Network meta-analysis is a method to combine evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare a number of different interventions for a given clinical condition. Usually, this requires a connected network. A possible approach to link a disconnected network is to add evidence from nonrandomized comparisons, using propensity score or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons methods. However, nonrandomized comparisons may be associated with an unclear risk of bias. Schmitz et al. used single-arm observational studies for bridging the gap between two disconnected networks of treatments for multiple myeloma. We present a reanalysis of these data using component network meta-analysis (CNMA) models entirely based on RCTs, utilizing the fact that many of the treatments consisted of common treatment components occurring in both networks. We discuss forward and backward strategies for selecting appropriate CNMA models and compare the results to those obtained by Schmitz et al. using their matching method. CNMA models provided a good fit to the data and led to treatment rankings that were similar, though not fully equal to that obtained by Schmitz et al. We conclude that researchers encountering a disconnected network with treatments in different subnets having common components should consider a CNMA model. Such models, exclusively based on evidence from RCTs, are a promising alternative to matching approaches that require additional evidence from observational studies. CNMA models are implemented in the R package netmeta.},

  abstract = {A common problem of welfare states consists of a high unemployment risk for low-skilled workers. This is often attributed to a lack of jobs for the low-skilled, but it may as well be caused by a lack of incentives to work. Low-skilled workers are easily substitutable and therefore have little bargaining power. Hence, they are typically dependent on low-paid jobs. This may create disincentives to work, if the achievable market wage does not sufficiently exceed the welfare level. Workfare could be an efficient strategy to overcome such disincentives by introducing a work requirement for unemployed welfare recipients. In our paper we investigate the importance of such a supply side policy. We evaluate a pilot workfare project of a Berlin city community to integrate young people in social assistance into the labor market. Reference data are generated in collaboration with the German Employment Office. The participation effect is found to be positive and of relevant size, but not statistically significant. This indicates that selection biases detected in the allocation process of individuals to the program can be adjusted by econometric techniques, but only at the prize of reduced significance levels. Given the small sample sizes of pilot projects this calls for social experiments in controlled project designs.},

This study measures whether the analysis of administrative earnings has similar findings for employment and earnings as surveys, and what the impacts on employment and earnings are in the two and a half years past the four-year period of the survey. Implementing agency: U.S. Department of Labour (DOL). Context/population: The participants are disadvantaged youth aged 16 to 24-years-old in the United States. Study design: Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). A total of 9,409 participants were randomly assigned to the programme group to have the opportunity to enrol in the Job Corps and if they decided not to enrol they were considered no-shows. The control group had 5,977 eligible participants who do not participate in the Job Corps but have the opportunity to enrol in other programmes. The administrative records were used to analyse differences between these impact results and those of the survey. Study findings: To begin, the SER administrative data and the survey report a negative impact on earnings in 1995 and 1996, but then a positive impact in 1997 and 1998. Moreover, the data on reported earnings for the survey reports higher increases than the administrative data found. Similarly, the quarterly employment rates are higher for the survey data than the administrative data, but the annual rates are similar. Furthermore, reporting differences in 1998 reveal different earnings gains for that year between the two data sources. Next, after the period of four years covered by the survey, the administrative data shows no impact of the Job Corps programme on earnings or employment with the only exception being the age group 20- to 24-year-olds whose results have stayed the same across the survey and the administrative data. The benefit-cost estimates from the administrative data analysis report that the programme costs of the Job Corps outweigh the benefits to society, however, the programme is still cost-effective for the 20 to 24-year-old group whose results for earnings remained after the survey period. Finally, the Job Corps programme is still beneficial for participants because the services they receive make up for lost earnings.},

Networks of multicomponent interventions are typically sparse and classical NMA inference is not straightforward and prone to confounding. Ideally, we would like to disentangle the effect of each component to find out what works (or does not work).

First, vocational training has an economically meaningful impact~on youth labor market outcomes (+0.105SD), twice that reported in previous reviews. Second, country income level does not predict effect size magnitude -- implying that well-designed interventions can work irrespective of labor market challenges. Third, the time-profile and mechanism of successful trainings differ between High-income countries (HICs) and Lower-/Middle-income countries (L/MICs). In HICs, effect sizes increase over time and more intensive interventions yield larger impacts. In L/MICs, shorter interventions are associated with larger effect sizes but these are often short-lived. Our findings suggest that mechanisms of effective interventions differ: impacts result from a human-capital mechanism of training in HICs and from a signaling and screening mechanism in L/MIC.},

This has the effect of restricting the effects of educational attainments on earnings. This paper departs from this restrictive approach. It estimates the effect of Year 12 completion and VET qualifications on early career earnings using both a single and multiple treatment-effect approach. By using matching methods to estimate these effects, it also allows for the effects of educational qualifications differ between persons. It is found that neither completion of Year 12 nor a VET qualification has an effect on early career earnings over and above the forgone experience.},

  abstract = {Labor market prospects for youth have deteriorated significantly in many OECD countries over recent decades. While the extent and consequences of falling youth employment are commonly studied, attempts at understanding its causes have been much more limited. The present paper attempts to fill this explanatory gap. We suggest that the secular decline in youth employment can be accounted for by the structural change of skill. This process of structural change has two interrelated components: (a) one part where skill supply (individual educational attainment) and skill demand (educational requirements of jobs) grow together in what can be called matched upgrading and (b) another part where excess skill supply leads to mismatch and crowding-out. These components of skill growth have commonly been treated separately and incompletely in the literature. We build on both of them in developing our account of why the labor market for youth has weakened. Using data on 10 European countries from the EU Labor Force Surveys over the period 1998 to 2015, we estimate associations between the structural change of skill and youth employment decline.

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the effects of an active labor market policy (ALMP) reform, the so-called SOR measure (vocational training for work without commencing employment), on youth labor market outcomes in the newest EU member state---Croatia. In 2012, SOR was redesigned to ease the first labor market entry and promote on-the-job training, enabling a young person without relevant work experience to get a one-year contract and a net monthly remuneration of 210 euro, while after 2014, the measure also became a part of the European Youth Guarantee. Pooling Croatian Labor Force Surveys from 2007 to 2016 and using the difference-in-difference strategy, we estimate the causal intent-to-treat effect of the program reform on labor market outcomes. The main results indicate that the reform has had, at best, neutral effects on employment and unemployment, while there is evidence that a portion of young individuals was propelled into inactivity. Though expected, adverse effect on wages---both at the mean and at higher percentiles of the wage distribution---is driven mostly by wages received by women and university graduates.},

The intervention modified a program titled Project SEARCH and incorporated the use of applied behavior analysis to develop Project SEARCH plus Autism Spectrum Disorder Supports. A randomized clinical trial compared the implementation of Project SEARCH plus Autism Spectrum Disorder Supports with high school special education services as usual. Participants were 49 high-school-aged individuals between the ages of 18 and 21 years diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and eligible for supported employment. Students also had to demonstrate independent self-care. At 3 months post-graduation, 90\% of the treatment group acquired competitive, part-time employment earning US\$9.53-US\$10.66 per hour. Furthermore, 87\% of those individuals maintained employment at 12 months post-graduation. The control group's employment outcomes were 6\% acquiring employment by 3 months post-graduation and 12\% acquiring employment by 12 months post-graduation. The positive employment outcomes generated by the treatment group provide evidence that youth with autism spectrum disorder can gain and maintain competitive employment. Additionally, there is evidence that they are able to advance within that time toward more weekly hours worked, while they also displayed increasing independence in the work setting.},

This answers the research question, ``Are psychological interventions in general effective?'' In fact, psychological interventions are usually complex with several different components. The authors propose that mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis methods may be a valuable tool when exploring the efficacy of interventions with different components and combinations of components, as this allows one to answer the research question, ``Are interventions with a particular component (or combination of components) effective?'' The authors illustrate the methods using a meta-analysis of psychological interventions for patients with coronary heart disease for a variety of outcomes. The authors carried out systematic literature searches to update an earlier Cochrane review and classified components of interventions into 6 types: usual care, educational, behavioral, cognitive, relaxation, and support. Most interventions were a combination of these components. There was some evidence that psychological interventions were effective in reducing total cholesterol and standardized mean anxiety scores, that interventions with behavioral components were effective in reducing the odds of all-cause mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and that interventions with behavioral and/or cognitive components were associated with reduced standardized mean depression scores.},

This article contributes innovatively to several statistical aspects of CNMA. First, by introducing a unified notation, we establish that currently available methods differ in the way they assume additivity, an important distinction that has been overlooked so far in the literature. In particular, one model uses a more restrictive form of additivity than the other which we term an anchored and unanchored model, respectively. We show that an anchored model can provide a poor fit to the data if it is misspecified. Second, given that Bayesian models are often preferred by practitioners, we develop two novel unanchored Bayesian CNMA models presented under the unified notation. An extensive simulation study examining bias, coverage probabilities, and treatment rankings confirms the favorable performance of the novel models. This is the first simulation study to compare the statistical properties of CNMA models in the literature. Finally, the use of our novel models is demonstrated on a real dataset, and the results of CNMA models on the dataset are compared.},

Study questions: What is the available evidence on the effects of prevention and intervention programs aimed at primary and secondary students for increasing school completion or reducing school dropout? Inclusion criteria: The studies were included if they met the following criteria 1) Involved a school-based or affiliated psychological, educational or behavioural prevention or intervention program intended to have beneficial effects on students recipients; or evaluated a community-based program explicitly presented as a dropout prevention or intervention program 2) Investigated outcomes for interventions directed towards school-aged youth, or those expected to attend pre-k to 12th grade primary and secondary schools or the equivalent. 3) Used experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, including random assignment, non-random assignment with matching or non-random assignment with statistical controls or sufficient information to permit calculation of pre-treatment effect size group equivalence. 4) Reported at least one eligible outcome variable measuring school completion, school dropout, high school graduation or school attendance. 5) The date of publication or reporting of the study must have been in 1985 or later. Number of included studies: 548 reports describing 167 different studies were included. Context/settings of included studies: A large proportion of the literature on dropout program was not published in peer-reviewed journals, but rather in technical reports (55\%) or dissertations (22\%). Most of the technical reports were of high quality and published by government and non-government agencies. A great proportion of the technical reports used random assignment designs (49\%) than did the journal articles (24\%). Attrition averaged about 11\% across the studies of general programs that reported it. Study findings: Both general dropout programs and programs specialized for teen parents were effective in reducing school dropout (or increasing school completion). The random effects weighted means OR was 1.72 for general programs (dropout rate = 21.1\% in the control groups and 13\% in the program groups). For the teen parent programs, the mean OR for graduation and dropout outcomes was 1.83 (average graduation rate= 26\% for the control and 39\% for the programs) and was 1.55 for school enrolment outcomes (average enrolment rate for comparison mothers= 33\% and 43\% for the programs)},

  abstract = {A crisis for youth labor market conditions has been building globally for more than two decades, reflected in the persistently high rates of youth unemployment around the world, which is about three times as high as that for adults. About one in five young people are not in education, employment, or training, and a large share of young adults are working in the informal economy or in precarious conditions. This volume includes a collection of thirteen articles that examine the causes, patterns, and consequences of labor market uncertainties for youth and young adults in Europe, Latin/South America, the United States, and Asia, as well as a concluding article. They reveal vast inequalities among young people, with those having the least education and lowest skills, females, those with low family socioeconomic status (SES), ethnic minorities, and migrants being the most vulnerable. In this introduction, we describe the global trends and regional variation in labor market conditions for young people, explicate the importance of integrating young people into labor markets, and summarize the findings and policy implications of these articles.},

  abstract = {Government-sponsored job-training programs must be subject to evaluation to assess whether their effectiveness justifies their cost to the public. The evaluation usually focuses on employment and total earnings, although the effect on wages is also of interest, because this effect reflects the increase in human capital due to the training program, whereas the effect on total earnings may be simply reflecting the increased likelihood of employment without any effect on wage rates. Estimating the effects of training programs on wages is complicated by the fact that, even in a randomized experiment, wages are "truncated" (or less accurately "censored") by nonemployment, that is, they are only observed and well-defined for individuals who are employed. In this article, we develop a likelihood-based approach to estimate the wage effect of the US federally-funded Job Corps training program using "Principal Stratification". Our estimands are formulated in terms of: (1) the effect of the training program on wages for those who would be employed whether they were trained or not, also called the survivor average causal effect (SACE), and the proportion of people in this category; (2) the wages when trained for those who would be employed only when trained, and the proportion of people in this category; (3) the wages when not trained for those who would be employed only when not trained, and the proportion of people in this category; (4) the proportion of people who would be not employed whether trained or not. We conduct likelihood-based analysis using the EM algorithm, and investigate the plausibility of important submodels with scaled loglikelihood ratio statistics.We also conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to specific parametric assumptions. Our results suggest that all four types of people [(1)-(4) previously] exist, which is impossible under the usual monotonicity assumptions made in traditional econometric evaluation methods. {\copyright} 2009 American Statistical Association.},

  abstract = {A primary task for youth aging out of foster care is finding and maintaining a job. In recognition of the challenges that foster youth face, employment assistance has become an important part of child welfare agencies' efforts to prepare youth for emancipation. The current study uses random assignment to evaluate the impact of an employment assistance programme for foster youth on the rate of employment, income and other self-sufficiency outcomes among a group of adolescents in substitute care in Kern County, California. Data were collected via multi-wave, in-person interviews of 254 foster youth. At the second follow-up interview, only two-fifths of the sample report being employed. However, three-quarters of the sample are either working or attending school, and a quarter reports both working and attending school. Nevertheless, significant minorities report experiencing financial hardships and receiving financial assistance. No statistically significant impacts of the evaluated programme are found on any measured employment or self-sufficiency outcome. Implications for child welfare policy are discussed.},
