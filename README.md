This repository [hosts a site](https://davetayl-r.github.io/youth-employment-nma-paper/youth-employment-nma-supplementary-material.html) that contains supplementary material, data and analysis code for a network meta-analysis titled "A rapid review and network meta-analysis of employment and skills interventions designed to assist young people to enter the labour market in high income countries".

The following information is available as part of the supplementary material:

* **Identification and selection of relevant studies** -- this section contains additional information on our search strategy  
* **Extraction and transformation of information from relevant studies** -- this section contains information on:
    a) what we extracted from included studies,  
    b) how we selected outcomes where multiple options existed, and     
    c) a log of decisions we made in the transformation of reported resutls into a common effect size.  
* **Supplementary information about included and excluded studies** -- this section contains information on: 
    a) how we distinguished between multiple reports of the same study,  
    b) studies we rejected at full-text review, and  
    c) details of studies that reported outcomes they we were not able to to quantitatively synthesise in a network meta-analysis.  
* **Analysis of relevant studies** -- this section contains the full results of the quantitative synthesis that we undertook, including interaction models, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, publication bias assessments and incoherence assessments.  
* **PRISMA 2020 Checklist** -- includes details of how this review meets the PRISMA 2020 reporting guidelines.  

The following information is available in the repository:

* the folder `network-meta` contains all of the code required to transform effect sizes (`es-transformation`), undertake the network meta-analysis (`nma`) and produce visualisations (`visualisations`) used in the publication
* the folder `supplementary-material` contains all of the code and input required to reproduce the supplementary materials
